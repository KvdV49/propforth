EEprom Development System

0. To run a EEprom Devopment System version of PropForth, 
Connect a propclip/plug to any prop system with an eeprom
with 64k bytes of eeprom or more, and use the Propeller Tool
to compile and load:

EEpromKernel.spin

IMPORTANT: Do not install this kernel on a system with on 32k of EEprom, such as the Demo board.
           If you write files, result may be indeterminate.

IMPORTANT: The EEPROM kernel automatically atempts to run a script named boot.f from the EEPROM.
           An uninitialized or corrupted boot.f script in the EEPROM may cause the kernel to hang
           with no error message or prompt or otherwise behave badly. If you are unsure of what is
           on the eeprom, boot without running boot.f as ia described below.

IMPORTANT: if at any time you wish to boot the propeller without running boot.f,
           hold down the ESC key while rebooting.
           Type in:
                       reboot
              hit enter
              hold down the ESC key until PropForth reboots


            or
              hold down the ESC key, and power cycle the board or hit reset

            When the cursor starts moving horizontally across the screen, the reboot is
            complete. This usually takes 3 - 4 seconds.

            You should see something like this:

Prop0 Cog6 ok
                               <<CURSOR>>

            If you do not hold escape key, or start holding it down too late after the reboot,
            and you have a boot.f file in your eeprom, it will load, and you may not see the
            above results.

            This is necessary if you have previously installed files in the eeprom
            file system.

            For this process, boot while holding down the ESC key.


1. Connect to the serial port using teraterm with the following settings:


Terminal Program Configuration:

teraterm->Setup->Serial port ::	Port: COMx , Baud rate: 230400 , Data: 8-bit , Parity: none ,
				Stop: 1-bit , Flow control: none , Transmit delay: 0 , 0

teraterm->Setup->Terminal ::	New-line Receive: CR , Transmit: CR


Other terminal programs should be ok with similar settings.

2. reboot while holding down the ESC key

3. Paste the contents of the file:
EEprom_boot.f
into teraterm

4. reboot

Enjoy PropForth






ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

To allow for different hardware configuration options, the following
SPIN Config constants available: 

The following constants can be adjusted before compiling the spin file and loading the eeprom.
Not all parameters apply to all kernels.

  _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
  _xinfreq = 5_000_000

  dlrS_cdsz = 224           ' $S_cdsz forth word - changing this word requires a full recompile and regression

For the default serial port console.

  dlrS_txpin = 30           ' $S_txpin forth word 
  dlrS_rxpin= 31            ' $S_rxpin forth word 
  dlrS_baud = 57_600        ' $S_baud forth word- the actual baud rate is 4x this parameter
  dlrS_con = 7              ' $S_con forth word

The default cog on boot.

  startcog = 6


The crystal frequency, _xinfreq, is set to 5 Mhz PropForth has been tested at 5 & 6 Mhz, other
frequencies should work, but they have not been tested.

The amount of main memory reserved for each cog, dlrS_cdsz, should only be changed by advanced
users. This should never be decreased, but could be increased. There are many implications to
changing this, and a full regression will need to be run.

The console, dlrS_con, is set to 7 by default. One cog is used at startup to run the serial driver
and provide a console connection to other cogs. This can be changed for different system 
configurations.

The start cog, startcog, is set to 6 by default. This is the first cog started, and connects to
the console. This can be changed for different system configurations.

The following apply to various kernels, they are always provided for reference.


The sd card configuration.

  dlrS_sd_cs= 19            ' $S_sd_cs
  dlrS_sd_di= 20            ' $S_sd_di
  dlrS_sd_clk= 21           ' $S_sd_clk
  dlrS_sd_do= 16            ' $S_sd_do

Ethernet / IP / Telnet / HTTP configuration.
