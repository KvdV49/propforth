Standard Development System

0. To run a Standard Devopment System version of PropForth, 
Connect a propclip/plug or use the direct USB connection (as available)
to any prop system with an eeprom, and use the Propeller Tool to compile and load:

DevKernel.spin

1. Connect to the serial port using teraterm with the following settings:


Terminal Program Configuration:

teraterm->Setup->Serial port ::	Port: COMx , Baud rate: 230400 , Data: 8-bit , Parity: none ,
				Stop: 1-bit , Flow control: none , Transmit delay: 0 , 0

teraterm->Setup->Terminal ::	New-line Receive: CR , Transmit: CR


Other terminal programs should be ok with similar settings.


Enjoy PropForth




ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

To allow for different hardware configuration options, the following
SPIN Config constants available: 

The following constants can be adjusted before compiling the spin file and loading the eeprom.
Not all parameters apply to all kernels.

  _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
  _xinfreq = 5_000_000

  dlrS_cdsz = 224           ' $S_cdsz forth word - changing this word requires a full recompile and regression

For the default serial port console.

  dlrS_txpin = 30           ' $S_txpin forth word 
  dlrS_rxpin= 31            ' $S_rxpin forth word 
  dlrS_baud = 57_600        ' $S_baud forth word- the actual baud rate is 4x this parameter
  dlrS_con = 7              ' $S_con forth word

The default cog on boot.

  startcog = 6


The crystal frequency, _xinfreq, is set to 5 Mhz PropForth has been tested at 5 & 6 Mhz, other
frequencies should work, but they have not been tested.

The amount of main memory reserved for each cog, dlrS_cdsz, should only be changed by advanced
users. This should never be decreased, but could be increased. There are many implications to
changing this, and a full regression will need to be run.

The console, dlrS_con, is set to 7 by default. One cog is used at startup to run the serial driver
and provide a console connection to other cogs. This can be changed for different system 
configurations.

The start cog, startcog, is set to 6 by default. This is the first cog started, and connects to
the console. This can be changed for different system configurations.


The following apply to various kernels, they are always provided for reference.

The sd card configuration.

  dlrS_sd_cs= 19            ' $S_sd_cs
  dlrS_sd_di= 20            ' $S_sd_di
  dlrS_sd_clk= 21           ' $S_sd_clk
  dlrS_sd_do= 16            ' $S_sd_do
