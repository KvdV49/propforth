= Introduction =

The primary motivation behind the propforth project is training in micro controllers for absolute beginners and above. While the majority of this site documents the development of the propforth core, this page begins examination of a possible application of the propforth core in a "training environment".  

Notes for the BSA Merit badge effort are combined with the School Robotics effort in this page.
