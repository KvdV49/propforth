#summary User Guide for the Little Robot(tm)
#labels v5.3,LittleRobot

= Introduction =

The User Guide is also the functional specification for the software.  The User Guide is written first, and the firmware is written to comply with the functional description.  Both components, the User Guide and the firmware, will influence each other during development.  

= Description =

The Little Robot(tm) Project is designed to demo the capabilities of micro controller software/firmware. The target microcontroller considered here is the Parallax Propeller P8X32A.  Other devices may also be used, at the user's discretion.

= Baseline Hardware =

The Little Robot (tm) consists of:
 * two stepper motors per the LittleRobotBOM
 * one utlrasonic ranfgfinder module per the LittleRobotBOM
 * one bluetooth module per the LittleRobotBOM
 * any standard Propeller board or equivalent

Besides the user supplied microcontroller, other user supplied hardware will be needed. Anything you want to use is OK, harvested parts are fine.  These include:

 * wheels 
 * battery holder
 * a chassis (can be 3D printed, carved from wood, etc)
 * various wires
 * various screws and small parts 

The fun is building the mechanical parts of the bot from nothing.  You may be surprised how easy it is! 

= Functions =

The Little Robot only has three subsystems, and these only have a few 
simple functions.  You can do these in any order.

== Ultrasonics Range finder ==

The ultrasonic range finder distance measurement unit only needs two functions:
  # trigger a measurement pulse sequence 
  # Report the measurement

See the extension for the ultrasonic rangefinder driver in the extensions directory /misc of the v5.3 download archive.

`SR04.f`

== Stepper Motors == 

The stepper motor has only a few simple functions. These are:

 # Stop
 # Rotate Clockwise (CW)
 # Rotate Counterclockwise (CCW)
 # Rotate Slow (Half steps)
 # Rotate FAST (Full steps)
 # Acceleration (how quickly the stepper reaches it maximum speed)

The rotation can further  be controlled by adjusting the acceleration and rate.

See the extension for the stepper motor driver in the extensions directory /misc of the v5.3 download archive.

`4step.f`

== Bluetooth Cable Replacement ==

The Bluetooth module allow communication with the propforth command line wirelessly, using any bluetooth capable device, and a suitable terminal program.

Remember, the propforth.SPIN file must be adjusted so communication occurs on the Bluetooth pins 26 & 27 instead of the default RS232 pins 30 and 31.

The Bluetooth module only has one function, tha it "Communicate".  When the bluetooth is installed, configured, and mated with your bluetooth master device, and your bluetooth master device is running a suitable terminal program, communications is established.  The propforth command line is available just as if it we hardwired to the PC running teraterm. 

== OPTIONAL: LEDs ==

The Propeller Quickstart has 8 LEDs on pins 16-23.  These can be used as indicators and for diagnostics. LEDs in this same configuration can be added to any standard propeller oboard.  The LEDs can be driven using the Quickstart touchpad demo example.

The LEDS have two functions:

 # LED on
 # LED off

for all 8 LEDs

== OPTIONAL: Touch Pad buttons ==

The Propeller Quickstart has 8 resistive touch pad buttons on pins 0-7.  These can be used as indicators and for diagnostics. Resistive touch pad buttons  in this same configuration can be added to any standard propeller oboard.  The Resistive touch pad buttons  can be driven using the Quickstart touchpad demo example.

The touch button report one of two values for the button state:

 # touched
 # not touched

Remember, the touch pads are scanned MANY times a second.  When use with the LEDs, the LEDS are very quickly set ON as soon as the button is touched, and OFF as soon as the button is not touched.

If you try to light an LED, but it does not light, consider that the touch button driver may be setting the LED back to the OFF value faster than the LED can turn on!

= Pre-Construction: Test the Electronics =

Be sure to test the components before assembleing the bot. After assembly, test to compenents again to ensure nothing got confused.
