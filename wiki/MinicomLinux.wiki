#summary Using Minicon on Linux as termianl program

= Introduction =

If one switches from Windows to Linux, Oracle Virtualbox is needed to run a virtual WindowsXP session, to initially run the Proptool.

After that all we need is a terminal program to talk to the propforth command line over serial , directly from linux.

One option for a terminal communication program is minicom

= Install Minicom =

{{{
sudo apt-get minicom
}}}

after your administrator password, select the defaults for the options; it installs

= Help for minicom =

Look at the MAN  pages, they are pretty complete 

{{{
man minicom
}}}


= Setup Minicom =

{{{
sudo minicom -s
}}}

If you don't use sudo, it won't let you save your changes to the setup

==  BAUD 230400 ==

there isn't a specific selection for 230400, but by pressing 
{{{
A -<next> 
}}}
it changes to the proper 230400

== USB ==

Change tt8 to USB

OK this worked before, I just have to remember what the setting is

/dev/tty8 - NO

/dev/usb0 - NO

/dev/usb1 - NO

/dev/usb - ??
