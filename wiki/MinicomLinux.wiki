#summary Using Minicon on Linux as termianl program

= Introduction =

If one switches from Windows to Linux, Oracle Virtualbox is needed to run a virtual WindowsXP session, to initially run the Proptool.

After that all we need is a terminal program to talk to the propforth command line over serial , directly from linux.

One option for a terminal communication program is minicom

= Install Minicom =

{{{
sudo apt-get minicom
}}}

after your administrator password, select the defaults for the options; it installs

= Help for minicom =

Look at the MAN  pages, they are pretty complete 

{{{
man minicom
}}}


= Setup Minicom =

{{{
sudo minicom -s
}}}

If you don't use sudo, it won't let you save your changes to the setup

==  BAUD 230400 ==

there isn't a specific selection for 230400, but by pressing 
{{{
A -<next> 
}}}
it changes to the proper 230400

== USB ==


=== find device ID ===

In a terminal, determine which ID is the usb converter

{{{
dmesg | grep tty
}}}

Yoou should see and output the describes the USB device you are looking for
{{{
braino@box0:~$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
[    1.301798] serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
[    1.324185] 00:08: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
[224734.385147] usb 5-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[224736.280339] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
}}}

So mine is on `ttyUSB0`

===  set serial port ===

  * sudo minicom -s
   * serial port setup
  * a -device: /ttyUSB0


/dev/ttyusb0
