#summary Using Minicon on Linux as termianl program

= Introduction =

If one switches from Windows to Linux, Oracle Virtualbox is needed to run a virtual WindowsXP session, to initially run the Proptool.

After that all we need is a terminal program to talk to the propforth command line over serial , directly from linux.

One option for a terminal communication program is minicom

= Install Minicom =

{{{
sudo apt-get minicom
}}}

after your administrator password, select the defaults for the options; it installs

= Help for minicom =

Look at the MAN  pages, they are pretty complete 

{{{
man minicom
}}}


= Setup Minicom =

{{{
sudo minicom -s
}}}

If you don't use sudo, it won't let you save your changes to the setup

==  BAUD 230400 ==

there isn't a specific selection for 230400, but by pressing 
{{{
A -<next> 
}}}
it changes to the proper 230400

== USB ==

=== find device ID ===

In a terminal, determine which ID is the usb converter

{{{
dmesg | grep tty
}}}

You should see and output the describes the USB device you are looking for
{{{
braino@box0:~$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
[    1.301798] serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
[    1.324185] 00:08: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
[224734.385147] usb 5-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[224736.280339] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
}}}

So mine is on `ttyUSB0`

===  set serial port ===

  * sudo minicom -s
  * serial port setup
  * a -device: /ttyUSB0

/dev/ttyusb0

* If it gives an error message DEVICE NOT PRESENT, it can be that the virtual XP session is still running, and has control of the USB to serial converter.  To release the USB from virtualbox,

In virtualbox under 
  * devices
  * USB devices

Un-check the USB to serial converter

=== other settings ===

The modem configuration settings in minicom are no needed, make these blanks:

  * modem and dialing:
     * init string - st? build?
     * reset string - sc st?
     * dialing prefix - blank
     * hangup string - blank (hangup will try to exit but will just leave you with the form command line running, you have to kill the terminal to end

In fact, it look like the `(ctl-z a)` help and configuration menu stops working after a bit.  More if I figure that out...
