The BOM Linked above does not (yet) include the kits that we sourced from Jeff (OBC) at Propeller Powered.

http://propellerpowered.com/shop/

Propeller Powered may elect to source kits for us; by buying the parts in bulk at a discount from suppliers (in China, etc) and packaging them into kits.  The small make up is well worth the convenience. But we have not verified that this fits his business model.  The first round of kits went very  smoothly.  Now we are looking into a custom electronic board for the little robot that contains all the necessary parts in a least cost and least size package.

= User Guide =

The User Guide is intended to define how a user will interact with the bot; this serves as a guideline for the code we need to write. 

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/LittleRobotUserInterface

The user guide is to be updated as we learn more about how folks REALLY use the bot.  The code is to be updated to reflect the current user needs. 

In any case, the high level user requirement drives the software requirements.  The degree to which we meet the requirements is what we measure. 

= User Interface =

The user interface is intended to describe the "nuts and bolts" of using the bot per the user interface.   The user guide and use interface pages may overlap or need to be combined into a single item.

This is supposed to contain links to the external pages.  It might be out of date or need re-organization

= Initial project info =

This stuff from this point on may be outdated.  Its what we started with. 

The Little Robot™ project has been refer to by various names: The Demo™, Football Bot™, [http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/CheapestPossibleRobot Cheapest Possible Robot™], Complex Datastreams and Filtering experiment™.  We decided to try "Little Robot™" since it lexically complete, sounds better and is less threatening than some of the other choices.  The target audience does not particularly care that complex data streams are filtered in real time, so long as it moves and looks cool.

The goal is to develop a compete, kid centric mobile robotics platform for under $20.  

The various components of the project will be documented on separate pages on this wiki. If it works out, these pages will be expanded as progress dictates.     

Here is a list of links to the LittleRobot(tm) Project

The rest of this page is background and high level discussion. 

= Target Audience =

Kids, older and younger siblings, parents, teachers.  Lend me  your ears!

The Little Robot™ project is a demo for the Propforth™ software project. The same hardware and algorithms may be used with any other software development environment, feel free to do so.  We plan to work towards an end to end solution using PropForth, this may be a handy reference point for other implementations.  

The intent is to develop a package simple enough so "non-techie™" parents can help the kids learn about cool stuff like building robots from scratch.  It also might include math, physics, mechanics, etc, but these will be hidden and nobody will know, it can be our little secret. 

= Simple Enough for Parents™? =

So how is this possible?  If it is possible, why hasn't it been done before?

Actually, its done all the time, with varying degrees of success.  In the past, there have been various "simple" programming environments that use BASIC programming language. There have been assorted kits that use micro controllers.  There have been countless kits for building robots. In the past, offerings have been too specialized, too complex, too simplistic, too expensive, or insufficiently marketed.  Many have had some degree of success, but few enjoy widespread, enduring popularity.

In recent months, several factors have changed, making this project attractive and promising.  Cheap equipment from China, 3D printing, the prop chip and this software project seem to point towards a "Little Robot" as a timely effort.

This project uses the FORTH programming language on the Parallax Propeller micro chip.  

FORTH is a neat language.  It is as easy as BASIC, but as powerful and fast as assembler. Like the C language, it can be considered a "universal assembler" language.  While C is especially suited for workstation processors, FORTH is especially suited for embedded applications on a micro controller.  Embedded applications are particularly suitable for small robots.  

FORTH is all about using numbers on a stack.  Folks familiar with other programming environments may find this unusual.  But kids have not prior experience.  They can learn anything, from Mario Karts to iPhones, if given the chance.  Nothing is any more unusual than anything else they've never seen before. 

Kids tend to figure out extremely complex systems such as playing thorugh a Mario world.  All we have to do is a structure like a video game (many rounds of practice for some gratification/goal, and a "boss challenge" at the end of the unit/chapter).   So the intent is to teach  how to view the "problem" as a collections of interesting puzzles to be solved (at least that's how I do it). 

= Easy to Start =

The main premise of this project is its easy to start. 

The special robot parts for the basic unit can be obtain directly from sources in China for under $20.  We have at least one party that will source the parts and send them out as "kits", saving us the problems of buying one parts from many different vendors.  You can go with either lowest cost or convenience, depending on you r budget and preferences. 

The micro controller is $8 by itself, although it needs some additional support circuitry.  But this is minimal, and can be easily obtained and built for a few dollars. 

The software is FREE, as in FREE; it can be downloaded and used for any purpose. 

The user has to have access to a PC or workstation of some type.  This is not an issue as these are common place.  If it is an issue, tell us you situation and we can try to point you towards a solution. 

So depending on where you start, you can git' goin' with $20, maybe $50 if you buy all the parts new.  For this price, entry should be possible for many folks. 

= User Guide =

To define how the robot interface should look, we starter with the User Guide. the robot may or may not work exactly this way, but this was our starting point for high level requirements.  The robot function should match this doc, and the doc should match the robot.  Any differences should be resolved.

= Type 1 - 20120818 "Cheapest Possible" configuration example =

There was/is a separate discussion for the cheapest possible robot. This was before we chose the name Little Robot.

== Purchasable Parts: ==

[http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/LittleRobotBOM LittleRobotBOM]

== Driver Software: ==

These are either included in the Propfroth download archive, or are posted on the downloads pages as they are introduced.    This is also a WIKI page for each that is updated as question come in. 

LittleRobotSteppers

LittleRobotBluetooth

LittleRobotUltraSonic

== User Created Parts: ==

Some pats are not included in the kit.  It is not possible to supply a standard part that fits every need.  All parts in the bot are changeable/upgradable, these parts are best sized depending on the intended use of the bot.  In the common case of the intended use of the bot is "general experimenting", then designing and build these is part of the plan. 

LittleRobotChassis

LittleRobotWheels

Of course, these parts can also be purchased from various sources, but that tend to be too expensive and less fun that DIY solutions.

= Type 2 - YYYMMDD - "Additional Sensors" Example =

Additional Sensor will go here.  These have not been implemented yet

== 10DOF INU ==

for example 20130214 - this unit is $13 + $2 shipping

 http://www.ebay.com/itm/10DOF-L3G4200D-ADXL345-HMC5883L-BMP085-Nine-Axis-IMU-Module-ge-/281043201090?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item416f7aec42

NOTE: I got mine for $29 about six months ago

== DS00 Laser Range finder ==

= Type 3 - YYYMMDD - "OutDoor" model =

The "outdoor modele"  has not been implemented yet.  We plan to go outdoors (wireless) when the weather gets nice, and we have enough users to warrant this.

= Type 4 - air ships = 

If uit ever gets this far I have dreams of all kinds of air bots.

== Blimp type ==

== Quadcopter type ==

== Tricopter type ==
