The Little Robot© project has been refer to by various names: The Demo©, Football Bot©©, [http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/CheapestPossibleRobot Cheapest Possible Robot©], Complex Datastreams and Filtering experiment©.  We decided to try "Little Robot©" since it lexically complete, sounds better and is less threatening than some of the other choices.  The target audience does not particularly care that complex data streams are filtered in real time, so long as it moves and looks cool.

The various components of the project will be documented on separate pages on this wiki. If it works out, these pages will be expanded as progress dictates.     

= Target Audience =

Kids, older and younger siblings, parents, teachers.  Lend me  your ears!

The Little Robot© project is a demo for the Propforth© software project. The intent is to develop a package simple enough so "non-techie©" parents can help the kids learn about cool stuff like building robots from scratch.  It also might include math, physics, mechanics, etc, but these will be hidden and nobody will know, it can be our little secret. 

= Simple Enough for Parents? =

So how is this possible?  If it is possible, why hasn't it been done before?

Actually, its done all the time.  In the past, there have been various "simple" programming environments that use BASIC programming language. There have been assorted kits that use micro controllers.  There have been countless kits for building robots. 

In the past, offerings have been too specialized, too complex, too simplistic, too expensive, or insufficiently marketed.  Many have had some degree of success, but few enjoy widespread, enduring popularity.

In recent months, several factors have changed, making this project attractive and promising.  Cheap equipment from China, 3D printing, the prop chip and this software project seem to point towards a "Little Robot" as a timely effort.

This project uses the FORTH programming language on the Parallax Propeller micro chip.  

FORTH is a neat language.  It is as easy as BASIC, but as powerful and fast as assembler. Like the C language, it can be considered a "universal assembler" language.  While C is especially suited for workstation processors, FORTH is especially suited for embedded applications on a micro controller.  Embedded applications are particularly suitable for small robots.  

FORTH is all about using numbers on a stack.  Folks familiar with other programming environments may find this unusual.  But kids have not prior experience.  They can learn anything, from Mario Karts to iPhones, if given the chance.  Nothing is any more unusual than anything else they've never seen before. 

= Easy to Start =

The main premise of this project is its easy to start. 

The special robot parts for the basic unit can be obtain directly from sources in China for under $20.

The micro controller is $8 by itself, although it needs some additional support circuitry.  But this is minimal, and can be easily obtained and built for a few dollars. 

The software is FREE, as in FREE; it can be downloaded and used for any purpose. 

The user has to have access to a PC or workstation of some type.  This is not an issue as these are common place.  If it is an issue, tell us you situation and we can try to point you towards a solution. 

So depending on where you start, you can git' goin' with $20, maybe $50 if you buy all the parts new.  For this price, entry should be possible for many folks.
