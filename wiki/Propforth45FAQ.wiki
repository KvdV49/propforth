#summary FAQ for Propforth 4.5 Release
#labels Phase-Support,v4.5

= Introduction =

A bit different for this release, I'm going to post all the questions and answers from various locations in one place. This is actually not limited to "frequently" asked questions. 

Newer Topics to be added to the top.

= Question 1 - caskaz SD issues =

caskaz was the original developer on the SD support, starting in v4.0. Now at release 4.5, he is the only one reporting problems.  Since there are already several reports of success by other beyond the development team, we thing the sd code and tests are working according to requirements.

The error messages caskaz is getting are 167 (A7 not A6 as reported in the thread -check if something else is wrong), 172, and 163. 

Sal interprets these as the CARD REPORTS it is not SD V2+.  Could these be old V1 standard, or MMC?  These are not supported, as these were hard to find, and so untestable. 

During development, Sal could not find examples of non v2 cards, the V1 standard was weak and/or not adhered to by manufacturers.  Sal specifically order old parts off of Ebay to try to find examples of the older tech.  But since these were unreliable, apparently folks discarded them. 

After discussion, we have the following options:
1) caskaz get new cards that report SD v2+ at initialization in SD init. Hopefully these work.
2)  caskaz to turn on sd_debug (he did already, I think) and check the output of each word. Deterrmine if the cards are V1 or MMC, and develop support as required.  This is a lot of work for potentially small benefit.  (Is is cheaper to write new support for old card, or can you just buy new cards and be done with it)
3) prof_braino to ship card successfully initialized and formatted with SD_SCRIPT.f to caskaz.  A known working card will verify that cakkaz's hardware is correct or not; but we have confidence in caskaz's ability, so we think this is not required
4) caskaz to ship one or more cards to Sal, for debugging.  (last option)

== Question 2 Assembler =
