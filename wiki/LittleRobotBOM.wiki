#summary Bill of MAterials (BOM) for Little Robot

<wiki:toc max_depth="9" />

= Introduction =

Little Robot is an example of a mobile robotic platform for embedded systems experimentation. We want it cheap enough so just about anybody can participate.

The user may purchase the recommended parts, or replace any parts with custom selections.  The design is indented to be upgradable.  As the project evolves and users become more capable, the complexity of the system will increase, and allow upgrades and enhancements. 

= Theoretical Kit versus Actual Kit =

Theoretically, all one needs are the key partS, which can usually be obtained for under $20. In reality, one also need all the non-key parts as well, and these bear significant cost.

This learning cost me about a year, and cash price of all the parts I had to buy. There were several iterations.  

*You can avoid this extra cost by reading this page* 

== Key Parts ==

The key parts are:
  * HC05/HC06 Blue Tooth serial cable replacement
  * SR04 ultrasonic range finder
  * ULN2003 stepper driver and 28BYJ-48 stepper motor (pair)

These can usually be obtained for under $20

== the rest of the parts ==

Notice the above assumes the user already has a Quickstart,  a battery case, a chassis, some wheels, resistors, the ability to solder surface mount parts, assorted wires and/or breadboards and/or prototyping solder boards, fasteners, glue, machine shop equipment, assorted hand tools. 

While all members of the Parallax forum have these materials readily available, we found that the schools and NEW participants generally do not, hence the kits. 

== Order the kit or the individual parts (?) ==

If you continue with your pursuit of robotics, eventually, you will want a complete shop and a full inventory of parts and equipment.  However, if you do not continue in electronics, robotics etc, you will not want this extra expense.

Historically only 10% of the poular becomes engineers.  If this hold true (maybe it won't) a portion of you will NOT want to invest in a mountain of equipment and inventory.  Try it out before you spend all you folks dough. 

Before you commit, try the kit.  

This is the least cost exploration of robotics, by design.  All the parts are reusable, and will serve as an excellent foundation for your adventure. If you decide not to continue, the cost is no more than one of those dozen unplayed video games sitting in the drawer.

= Ordering the BOM =

The Bill of Materials is (supposed to be) updated each time we find a better way to meet the needs at lowest cost and effort. 

You can order from me or order directly from China.  Order from me is recommended, I have to do this anyway, and you are not saving any money after shipping and handling.  Even if you break even (you probably won't unless you do a large volume for each single purchase), you will have to deal with the extras that you have to handle and store and never use. Unused inventory is a killer!  If you are getting more than ONE, Order the braino kits, at least you know that are complete and up to date with the latest greatest BOM. It also easier to support your questions, as I will know exactly what you have.

Purchase Price $107.63

Bulk order price $47.34

== Locally available materials ==

  * Two Wheels are not orderable until I get the source arranged, please purchase or fabricate locally]
  * 4xAA batteries NiHM. Alkaline Batteries are too high at 1.5 volts, use NiMH.


== Summary ==

IF one orders parts for one kit, the price is about $100 (depending on Ebay)

IF one orders bulk parts, about 25 or more, the price may drop by half. 

The above prices do not include shipping.  

*I think that if I order in bulk and split the difference between the bulk kit price and the single kit price, I can offer kits cheaper than the one-off price, and still make enough to cover expenses. I would have to order 50 to 100 kits at a time*

 ==  updates 20130515 - need changes ==

The original kits sourced from propellerpowered included:
 * "proto and more" board (kit that requires soldering)

We have discovered we need solderless solutions for kids.  We made these changes to the LittleRobot BOM:
 
  * 270 tie point bread board
  * Male to Female jumper wires (12) six per stepper motor
  * male to male jumper wires (9) 4 for ultrasonic, 5 for bluetooth
  * resistor 220-330 Ohms (for bluetooth echo pin output)
  * Batteries 4*AA
  * screws (8) two for each ot two motors, two for castor, remainder for other attachments 
  * castor wheel
  * Pink foam sheet from home store for chassis
  * USB cable, host to mini B 5 conductor (NOTE: the 4 conductor mini B won't work)

 
 == alternative ==

Use 21 M-F instead of breadboard

5 peices of 40x1 pins for $1.29

Vss Needs 2 motors, 1 ultra sonic, 1 battery case, 1 Quick start, 1 blue tooth
    * Vss needs six (6) positions total

Vin needs 2 motors, 1 ultra sonic, 1 battery case, 1 Quick start
    * Vin needs five (5) positions total

Vdd needs 1 blue tooth
  * remember, bluetooth is 3.3 volts, a SECOND Vdd is needed for 1 time reprogramming

Total 6 + 5 extra connection strips (plus a reusable "Y" connector for bluetooth reprogramming)
