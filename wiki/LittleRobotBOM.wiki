= Introduction =

Little Robot is an example of a mobile robotic platform for embedded systems experimentation. We want it cheap enough so just about anybody can participate.

The user may purchase the recommended parts, or replace any parts with custom selections.  The design is indented to be upgradable.  As the project evolves and users become more capable, the complexity of the system will increase, and allow upgrades and enhancements.
