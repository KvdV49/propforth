= Introduction =

Little Robot is an example of a mobile robotic platform for embedded systems experimentation. We want it cheap enough so just about anybody can participate.

The user may purchase the recommended parts, or replace any parts with custom selections.  The design is indented to be upgradable.  As the project evolves and users become more capable, the complexity of the system will increase, and allow upgrades and enhancements.

=  updates 20130515 - need changes =

The original kits sourced from propellerpowered included:
 * "proto and more" board (kit that requires soldering)

We have discovered we need solderless solutions for kids.  We made these changes to the LittleRobot BOM:
 
  * 270 tie point bread board
  * Male to Female jumper wires (12) six per stepper motor
  * male to male jumper wires (9) 4 for ultrasonic, 5 for bluetooth
  * resistor 220-330 Ohms (for bluetooth echo pin output)
  * Batteries 4*AA
  * screws (8) two for each ot two motors, two for castor, remainder for other attachments 
  * castor wheel
  * Pink foam sheet from home store for chassis
  * USB cable, host to mini B 5 conductor (NOTE: the 4 conductor mini B won't work)

 
= alternative =

Use 21 M-F instead of breadboard

5 peices of 40x1 pins for $1.29

Vss Needs 2 motors, 1 ultra sonic, 1 battery case, 1 Quick start, 1 blue tooth
    * Vss needs six (6) positions total

Vin needs 2 motors, 1 ultra sonic, 1 battery case, 1 Quick start
    * Vin needs five (5) positions total

Vdd needs 1 blue tooth
  * remember, bluetooth is 3.3 volts, a SECOND Vdd is needed for 1 time reprogramming

Total 6 + 5 extra connection strips (plus a reusable "Y" connector for bluetooth reprogramming)
