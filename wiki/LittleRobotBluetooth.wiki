The HC05 and HC06  Bluetooth module allows communication with the prop via bluetooth.  No cables are needed after initial programming. 

This pages covers the immediate set up steps for the HC06.  If you have problems, or want to use the hc05, see

for addditional details.

= HC06 =

The workshop is using the HC06 modules mounted on a 6 pin carrier board.  only Vcc (3.3v), GND, Rxd and Txd are used.

The following is a modification of the script found in bot.f

-----

= Pair the devices =

The HC05 should be visible as a slave (pairable) device when re-powered

== Windows XP ==

Run Blue Tooth Wizard 

The wizard should find a device, and display the name you provided in the the script. 

Enter your pin (as you assigned in the script, or 1234 if you left the default)

XP will add two COM ports, on incoming and one out going. 

The outgoing port is the one you will use with Teraterm.  The incoming port doesn't do anything, but has to be there. 

== Android ==

  * Select Settings.  
  * Under (or near) WiFi find Bluetooth. 
  * select "Search for Devices" (upper right corner on Nexus)

You should see an eight(?) hex value address displayed very quickly. 

A short time later this will change to the name you assigned in the script.

Select this, and enter your pin you define in the script, or 1234 if you left the default.

=== Blueterm ===

You can now connect to this device using Blue term (the three dots in the lower right corner is the secret!)
