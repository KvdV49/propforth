= Introduction =

The HC05 Bluetooth module allows communication with the prop via bluetooth.  No cables are needed after initial programming. 

Connect:

Ultrasonic - Prop - Wire Color
Pin 1 TX   - P25  - Grey  
Pin 2 RX   - P26  - white

Pin 34 Key - P27   - Green

Pin 12 3.3v - 3.3v - Orange
Pin 13 GND  - GND  - Blue

The HC05 does not have "PINS" per se.  It has teeny micro notches that are much closer together than the standard .1 inch spacing I usually work with.  But, you can solder a bit of wire to the notch, and make a connection to the prop. You can put a pin on the other end of the wire, and jab it right into the bread board or 40 pin female connector on a Quickstart board.

You can use any color wire you want, if you use the same color as we do yours will match the pictures. :)
