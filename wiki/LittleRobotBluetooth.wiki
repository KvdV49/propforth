= Introduction =

The HC05 Bluetooth module allows communication with the prop via bluetooth.  No cables are needed after initial programming. 

Connect:

|| HC05 Bluetooth module ||
|| HC05  || Prop || Wire Color||
||Pin 1 - TX  || P25 || Grey  ||
||Pin 2 - RX   || P26 || white||
||Pin 34 - Key || P27  || Green||
||Pin 12 - 3.3v ||3.3v || Orange||
||Pin 13 - GND  || GND || Blue||

The HC05 does not have "PINS" per se.  It has teeny micro notches that are much closer together than the standard .1 inch spacing I usually work with.  But, you can solder a bit of wire to the notch, and make a connection to the prop. You can put a pin on the other end of the wire, and jab it right into the bread board or 40 pin female connector on a Quickstart board.

You can use any color wire you want, if you use the same color as we do yours will match the pictures. :)

This source code is also included in the propforth download archive beginning with release v 5.3

NOTICE that for this Little Robot instruction page, I changed the pin assignment from Sal's instructions.  The instruction Sal made for the download archive are for his Gadget gangster board, these below are for the Quickstart.  You could use either for either, I find these pins are easier on the quickstart.
