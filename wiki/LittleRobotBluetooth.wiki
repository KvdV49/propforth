= Introduction =

The HC05 Bluetooth module allows communication with the prop via bluetooth.  No cables are needed after initial programming. 

Connect:

|| HC05 Bluetooth module ||
|| HC05  || Prop || Wire Color||
||Pin 1 - TX  || P27 || Grey  ||
||Pin 2 - RX   || P26 || white||
||Pin 34 - Key || P22  || Green||
||Pin 12 - 3.3v ||3.3v || Orange||
||Pin 13 - GND  || GND || Blue||

The HC05 does not have "PINS" per se.  It has teeny micro notches that are much closer together than the standard .1 inch spacing I usually work with.  But, you can solder a bit of wire to the notch, and make a connection to the prop. You can put a pin on the other end of the wire, and jab it right into the bread board or 40 pin female connector on a Quickstart board.

You can use any color wire you want, if you use the same color as we do yours will match the pictures. :)

This source code is also included in the propforth download archive beginning with release v 5.3

NOTICE that for this Little Robot instruction page, I changed the pin assignment from Sal's instructions.  The instruction Sal made for the download archive are for his Gadget Gangster board, these below are for the Quickstart.  You could use either for either, I find these pins are easier on the quickstart.

HC05 comes with 9600 baud by default.  

We run this script to 
 * give it a unique name (choose anything)
 * set baud to 230400
 * set (this one) to SLAVE mode
 * set the password (each kid connects to the correct bot)

I set the unique name to LittleRobotYYYMMDDhhmm

This way, each kid, in each class, gets a unique number.  When I meet with the robots again, I can somtimes tell when the bot came into service.
 
NOTICE that after the script run successfully, the bad rate has been set from 9600 to 230400.  So the script won't run a second time.  If you with to re-run the script (and name your bot "JimmyJohinson") you must change the comments so the script is set to 230400 like the HC05.

Later we can use this same script to add another bluetooth as MASTER, and make the bots talk over bluetooth, but that is a future exercise.

To use the HC05 as cable replacement:

After you have run the above script in propforth, and gotten the OK response for each configuration command, the HC05 is ready for use.

BUT you must also change the PROPFROTH KERNEL!

By default, propforth talks on pins 30 and 31.  

we have to change the spin file that creates the kernel to use pins 26 and 27 that connect to the HC05

In the proforth spin ource file

{{{
PropForthDevFastSerialKernel.spin
}}}

Edit lines 116 and 117:

{{{
  dlrS_txpin = 26 ' 30           ' $S_txpin forth word 
  dlrS_rxpin=  27 ' 31            ' $S_rxpin forth word 
}}}

Save the file as PropforthBluetooth.spin

Load it onto the prop EEPROM

The USB serial will no longer connect to propforth until the prop is reloaded with a standard kernel. 

Propforth will come up looking for the virtual Bluetooth com port.
