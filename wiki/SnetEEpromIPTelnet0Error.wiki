= The Error =

Braino cannot get HTTP test to run using v5.3RC3

I have not been able to run the full suite since I changed internet providers.   Originally this was due to router and firewall configuration differences. Now that those are  (mostly?) sorted out,there are other issues.

== Router ==

The telnet portion did not work.

=== Router -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding -> Spinneret Telnet ===
