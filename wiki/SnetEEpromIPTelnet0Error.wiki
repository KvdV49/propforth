= The Error =

Braino cannot get HTTP test to run using v5.3RC3

I have not been able to run the full suite since I changed internet providers.   Originally this was due to router and firewall configuration differences. Now that those are  (mostly?) sorted out,there are other issues.

== Router ==

The telnet portion did not work.  

=== Router -> Advanced -> Virtual Server -> Telnet ===

This should NOT be enabled for the spinneret IP address and port.

=== Router -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding -> Spinneret Telnet ===

This should NOT be enabled for the spinneret IP address and port.

129:3020-3023

=== internal /external ===

The is for internal visibility.  That is, I don't have to set anything to make it work locally.  I don't want to futz with setting to to get it visible externally (on the internet) until the internal errors are all corrected.
