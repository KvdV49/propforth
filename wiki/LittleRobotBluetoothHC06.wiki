= Summary =

So, these can be a little funky until you get used to them. Some don't seem to come up at 9600. 

FIRST: The RED LED must be flashing in order to talk to it. If the RED LED is NOT flashing, pull the ground wire and reconnect it.  

SECOND: CYCLE THE POWER. Pull the GND wire, and reconnect it.  Every other time, it goes into flashing (PAIRING) mode.  The HC06 needs to be in PAIRING mode to program it  

Third: Baud changes Immediately on HC06!!! Change baud LAST!!!

Thanks to Boy Chance (Vic) for helping figure out the HC06.

These are the command I used:
  * AT
  * AT+VERSION
  * AT+NAMEAnconaHC06-8
  * AT+PIN9999
  * AT+BAUD9
 
AT command produces  `ATOK` when it executes correctly

AT+VERSION comand procudes ` Linvor`  when it executes correctly

AT+NAMEAnconaHC06-8 produces  `nameset` when it executes correctly

AT+PIN9999 produces  `setPIN` when it executes correctly

AT+BAUD9 produces  `230400` when it executes correctly

AFTER THE BAUD COMMAND, it stops restonding, as the baud changed to 230400 on the HC06, but the Bluetooth Helper is still at 9600.  CHANGE BAUD LAST!!!



== HC06 KEY is Scallop 26 ==

 Ancona uses Jeff's HC06. The HC06 is slave only, this is sufficient for Ancona's current needs. 

The HC06 from proleer Powered is mounted on a carrier board.  we might not have KEY brought out to a connection.  I think either STATE or WAKEUP might be KEY, so we could try the 3.3 before Vcc trick to get the default 38400 baud. 


These connections are already done when using the PropellerPowered HC06 modules, as they come mounted on a carrier board. Convenient!  

Connect:

|| HC06 Bluetooth module ||
|| HC06  || Prop || Wire Color||
||Pin 1 - TX  || P27 || Grey  || closest to Antenna ||
||Pin 2 - RX   || P26 || white||
||Pin 12 - 3.3v ||3.3v || Orange||
||Pin 13 - GND  || GND || Blue||
||Pin 26 - Key || P22  || Green|| ~~closest to Antenna~~ halfway up the side ||

Jeff's module implement n LED that flashed when unpaired and is lit when paired.  We can do this in software on propforth, aand/or do a discrete LED.  Also do this on HC05...

*NOTE:* Be careful, you MUST set the BAUD Rate LAST.  After you change the baud rate, it stops talking at the current baud rate.  So your automatically done, whether you are or not. Don't even ask me how I know this. 

= setup HC06 (bare module, not carrier) =

Follow the instructions in Bluetooth-HC05-HC06.f
