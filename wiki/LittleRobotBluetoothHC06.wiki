== HC06 KEY is Scallop 26 ==

 Ancona uses Jeff's HC06. The HC06 is slave only, this is sufficient for Ancona's current needs. 

These connections are already done when using the PropellerPowered HC06 modules, as they come mounted on a carrier board. Convenient!  

Connect:

|| HC06 Bluetooth module ||
|| HC06  || Prop || Wire Color||
||Pin 1 - TX  || P27 || Grey  || closest to Antenna ||
||Pin 2 - RX   || P26 || white||
||Pin 12 - 3.3v ||3.3v || Orange||
||Pin 13 - GND  || GND || Blue||
||Pin 26 - Key || P22  || Green|| closest to Antenna ||

*NOTE:* Be careful, you MUST set the BAUD Rate LAST.  After you change the baud rate, it stops talking at the current baud rate.  So your automatically done, whether you are or not. Don't even ask me how I know this.

Follow the instructions in Bluetooth-HC05-HC06.f
