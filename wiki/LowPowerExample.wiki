PropForth.htm Section 8 has an example of low power mode.  This turns off inactive cogs to save power.  The monitoring cog looks for a transition on the serial input line.  When a transition is detected, the cog wakes up the prop chip.  

Most of the time, PropForth tends to be waiting for you next key press.  So this method should put the prop back to sleep until the next character is sent.  When the input is a return character (causing a word to execute) the cog will run the word first,  then go back to sleep.   A well crafted application might be able to make the quickstart run for a time approaching the shelf life of the batteries!  (Of course, it would have to be sleeping most of the time, but that often tends to be the case). 

In this example, the goal will be to configure the quickstart to communicate over bluetooth, and still attain a maximum operational life between battery changes.
