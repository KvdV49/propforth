  * Windows laptop
  * proptool installed
  * propforthv5.5 downloaded and unzipped
  * USB cable
  * devkernel.spin loaded to EEPROM
  * completed Hello World 
  * completed LED01

Jimmy does NOT have:

 * video conference software properly configured on laptop (maybe its just too old and broken?)
