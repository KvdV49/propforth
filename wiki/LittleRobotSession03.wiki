= Introduction =

Wednesday is instructor Jimmy conducting Lab and Review. 

Hopefully, we have prepared the instruction for session without developer support

Wednesday 20130501 was to be Jimmy's first session on his own, but this was overcome by events. The following session, Friday, we will try Lab and Review.   Professor Braino and Boy Chance will be present, but we will refrain from leading and observe how the lab might be conducted in our absence. 

Jimmy has most of what we think he needs:

  * Windows laptop
  * proptool installed
  * propforthv5.5 downloaded and unzipped
  * USB cable
  * devkernel.spin loaded to EEPROM
  * completed Hello World 
  * completed LED01

Jimmy does NOT have:

 * video conference software properly configured on laptop (maybe its just too old and broken?)
 * voice chat software properly configured on laptop 

WE need to fix this Friday

We have not completed the arrangements for one laptop per robot; there are some complications as laptops are not usually assigned to the younger students.

= Review =

Ensure everyone has complete Hello world, and trained anther;  then practice

Ensure everyone has completed pinhi, and trained another;  then practice

Ensure everyone has completed ascending descending LEDs, and trained another;  then practice

AFTER BREAK consider starting  IF...THEN
