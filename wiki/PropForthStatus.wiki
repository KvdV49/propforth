  ~~2010 October 10 PropForth 3.5~~ 

 ~~Yes, its sadly comical the way I do configuration management.  The code works the same in all version, I messed up the version strings and made tons of typos~~

The Standard kernel (Non VGA version) is 3.5c.  The VGA versions are have version string updates and are at version E.  Thanks to all the users that pointed this out. 

ALPHA Example speed optimization:  converting forth into assembly - tutorial to follow

HIVE and Demoboard configurations selectable by moving comment marks in:

 - Final Hi Res VGA

 - Low Res VGA option


removed from plan - TV option

=== 2010 Sept 29 PropForth 3.4 Hive version ===

 = unplanned release, braino finished the Hive build early =

Modified PropForth 3.4 to use Hive hardware pinout

 - Hive-PropforthHiResVGA.spin

 - Hive-HiResVGA.f

VGA and Keyboard have a different pin assignment than Demo Board.

We will try to re-factor the code to prevent parallel branches, target is 3.5 release

=== 2010 Sept 05 PropForth 3.4  ===

1. HiRes VGA Option - Jupiter ACE prototype - ALPHA Release:

   a. Uses Demoboard VGA pinout

   b. 128 characters (columns) wide by 64 lines (rows) 

   c. VGA screen is divided into two sections, top half and bottom half.
Tops half is Cog 3 forth prompt and bottom half is cog 4 forth prompt.  Serial terminal is now cog 5 

   d. Serial communications from ~~cog6~~ cog5 to PC terminal program is also active 

   e. uses standard PS/2 keyboard for communication with VGA terminal

   f. mouse support is not planned for this release

   g. see FAQ and JUPITER ACE 

   h. user testing and comments requested. Please play with it and send me any comments   

2. FORTH Output will NOT be in a different color from user input, due to differences in color settings for serial terminal versus VGA terminal

3. Ethernet support NOT added to this release

4. LOW RES VGA NOT included in this release 

=== Planned PropForth 3.3 Around September 2010 ===

*UPDATE:  Completed 2010-08-22

*Development release only, needs testing; not for public release

NOTE: CREATE word behaves differently in propforth - see FAQ

NOTE: lines commented using \  behave different in propforth - see FAQ

1. Add patches for definition of {{{ * ( : * u* ; ) }}} and other math functions

2. Add keyboard support

3. Add 32x15 VGA text support as extension' LowResVGA.f

4. Add 128x64 Hi Res VGA as commented option in PropForth.spin

5. Close outstanding issues that have been fixed, comment on  issue that has not been fixed.

6.  Begin support for multi-prop system (C3, Hive)

7. ethernet kernel support is NOT planned for 3.3; rescheduled to 3.4

=== 2010 July 09 PropForth 3.2 ===

PropForth 3.2 uses descriptive names and a simplified naming convention and achieves the intent described for the not-released version 3.0.  The design and architecture are the same as version 2.7, but the name changes will cause an UNDEFINED WORD error message for code using the old names.  The list of word changes in the README.txt file in the archive

NOTE: The UNDEFINED WORD error can also occur due to a serial overrun.  If you paste in a chunk of code to teraterm and see this error, you should paste smaller sections of text or use the {{{fl}}} (fileload) word

[http://code.google.com/p/propforth/downloads/detail?name=PropForth3.2%2020100710%20archive.zip PropForth3.2 20100710 archive.zip]

should help in updating existing code. 

Some of the files names have changed BACK to old names due to organizational issues.  Therefore the entire version 3.2 file set is posted as a single zip archive.  Please submit questions and requests based on the v 3.2 file set. 

The additional changes listed in version 2.8 will be added at a later date as time permits. 

=== Not Released PropForth 3.0 ===

Determined that original design allowing high level forth words to be unique to each cog was overly complex.  As it turns out, any words which need to be custom for a given cog tend to be assembler words.  PropForth 3.0 is planned to be a more standard forth, for example the current word mswHere will be replaced by the standard forth word HERE. No date has been targeted for this release.

=== Not Released PropForth 2.8 ===

Plan to add words to support calling forth from spin, and spin from forth. 

Plan to post the disassembler and documentation

Plan to post the ethernet interface

=== 2010 May 30 PropForth 2.7 ===

fix bug in saveforth for 64k page eeProm write

Fix key input time out 

Some documentation changes

Decided to start including a downloadable file PropForthX.X.zip to contain all releases files in a single archive.  This will be added when all updates are complete.

NOTE: Documentation changes are in progress
PLEASE send questions, this will help drive the documentation updates

=== 2010 May 9 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.6. A number of bug fixes.

=== 2009 October 24 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.5. One few bug fix, cogreset issue. eeReadPage and eeWritePage have been modified to support multiple 64kx8 eeproms. eeCopy word was added into the base image.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle. Some minor adds, words to sample at different rates.

float.f - ieee754 floating point routines added, very useful in development, still need to use fixed point math where speed is essential.


=== 2009 October 2 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.4. A few bug fixes, and a number of enhancements. Stack over/underflow reporting, the divide is now a mixed divide, 64 bits divided by 32 bits to give a 32 bit remainder and result. This is very useful when scaling prop counters.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle.

=== 2009 April 20 ===

Added doc for AddingSerialMonitor and a page for the logic analyzer [La], which is early code (V0.8)

=== 2009 April 19 ===

Files uploaded, basics documented, fair bit more documentation required.
