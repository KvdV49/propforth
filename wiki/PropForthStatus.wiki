#summary Status of PropForth kernel development

=== Propforth 5.0 targeted Summer 2011 ===
{{{
Redesign Propforth kernel:
 - minimal kernel, recover (most of?) hub memory
 - dictionary resides on SD card
 - SD resident definition loads itself from SD, executes, and removes itself from memory
 - Maximize space available for user applications
}}}
=== Propforth 4.6 targeted Spring 2011 (public release) ===

Bug fixes to 4.5 as needed 

=== Propforth 4.5 Released June 14, 2011 (public release) ===


~~ Propforth 4.5 (Update) targeted June 2011 (public release) ~~

(update)

SD

servers 
 * HTTP 
 * telnet 
 * running forth from a HTTP page

=== Propforth 4.5 targeted March/April 2011 (public release) ===

Final Spinneret Code 
 * Ethernet support
 * telnet support using character (byte) transfer
 * HTTP server support
 * NIST support
 * remote development over Internet support

Final SD support
 * micro SD slot support for Spinneret, C3, etc
 * Multiple partitions
 * Multiple files per partition
 * Any Cog may access any partition it has MOUNTED
 * One Cog may access multiple files
 * Multiple Cogs man access the same file
 * NO BUFFERING FOR the FILE SYSTEM.  The overhead in code and speed penalty is not worth it at this time. 
This method is nearly as fast as the speed of the SD card data transfer. 
 * The last file referenced is the current file, regardless of cog or partition.  

Decision is to not worry about SPACE EFFICIENCY on SD card, instead concentrate on ALIGNMENT to SD card 512 byte blocks.  
This gives maximum speed and efficiency on this system.  
We expect some discussion on this point until it is understood by users.
While this is a different paradigm than currently popular, is it very easy, fast and straight forward. 

NOTE:
 * NON FAT compatible in RAW form. We can't plug the SD into a windows box and read the files.  
Model is similar to the way the iPod SD card is only accessed "thru the iPod" when the iPod is connected to the PC; 
we seldom take the SD out of the iPod and manipulate the files directly. The Prop SD card will be accessed "thru the prop". 
 
CasKaz may continue on FAT-compatibility support if he find it necessary, and we ask him nicely. 

PWM support:
 * examples in forth for servo control
 * examples in forth for ESC control  (electronic speed controller)
 * examples in forth for stepper motor control

Improved documentation:
 * improved "white-space" handling
 * consistent stack notes
 * more inline comments
 * inline notation of external references 

NOTE: There is a consequence of the support added this release that will be addressed in Propforth 5.0.  The Ethernet and SD support will take a larger amount of dictionary space.  This is estimated to leave only 2-4k of space for application development.  Propforth 5.0 will attempt to redesign the kernel to free up hub space.

=== Propforth 4.4 April 2011 (development only, not for public release) ===

SD support:

Sal reviewed Caskas's SD code to find the bug that was giving problems.  It was noticed that because the clock is starting and stopping, some SD cards need a couple "stop bits" to get going.  Initially, most worked, some did not.  Sal added a stop bit, and more started working.  Sal added a second, and all his started working.  He added a third and has had no problems. 

The initial SD support will be a low-level, traditional forth "block access".  The idea is access to the card with minimal code and maximum speed.  This is suitable for Sal's embedded project needs.  The initial version will NOT be windows compatible.  Windows compatible extensions can be added using the provided low-level support words, but Sal feels its too big for the benefit it provides, and therefore will not be included in the default kernel.

We plan to review the code, and perhaps Caskaz will provide the extension with Windows FAT support. 

=== Propforth 4.3 Beta March 2011 (development only, not for public release) ===

Spinneret Ethernet support

=== Planned PropForth 4.2 March 2011 ===

Refinement on 4.0:
 changes to package:
  * PropForth Boot Kernel - contains minimum to be a forth system on the prop
  * PropForth Kernel - a subset of ANSI standard kernel words tailored to the prop.  These are extensions typically used in development. 
  * EEPROM file systems is not assumed present by default, due to 32k EEPROM on the demoboard.  Source code files in the distribution package now have "fswrite" and "..." commented out. Remove the comments on these words is you wish to use the EEPROM file system on your 64K or larger hardware

Source to be re-organized:
  * PropForth.spin
  * PropForthboot.spin

Functional Change:
 * PropForth to come up as DECIMAL by default
 * Number Base to be controled by HEX and DECIMAL words
 * Existing source may be loaded by including the HEX word at the start of source file, base will return to decimal after load is complete

Sal to draft article 1 "intro to using PropForth"

=== Planned PropForth 4.1 February 2010 === 4.1 changes to be delayed to a later release

 reference configuration for multiple romless leaf slaves

 reference configuration for multiple romless sub-masters (intermediate slaves) 

 Revert to non-printable characters (invisible characters) echoed as spaces

----

=== Planned PropForth 4.0b Release December 2010 ===

 Demoboard pin-out examples for MASTER/SLAVE support

 any minor bug fixes 

----

=== PropForth 4.0a Released December 18 2010 ===

 Corrected Typos in LogicAnalyzer.f, fs.f, README.txt

 Re-organized files names such that they appear in the directory in the order used  

 Added sub-directory with an example that does NOT reqire 64k EEPROM

   Note:  Demoboard pin out example for MASTER/SLAVE is not included in this example

   Note:  Spineret code is NOT final version, this is current state of development,

   Note: snet.f is a regular serial connection to spineret hardware, where MASTER opens a terminal to spineret's prop chip, but spineret wiznet support is not complete, this is current state of development, 

   Note:  Watch out for invisible characters,  these are not echoed as spaces in this version

----

=== PropForth 4.0 Released December 05 2010 ===

Reorganized Kernel:

 - {{{PropForth.spin}}}  - the simplest kernel that can compile forth source code in SPIN

 - {{{PropForthCore.f}}} - the simplest kernel that can compile forth source code FORTH SOURCE

 - {{{PropForth.f}}} - all necessary Kernel function beyond the core

It was determined that the kernel too big again.  During re-organization, the above method was selected.  All kernel functions will be available in high level forth source code. 

  - Standardize communication interfaces. 

All communications options (serial, VGA, Ethernet, high speed inter-prop serial channels) will have the same structure:  One long, first word is input, second word is output. The method to plug into a channel will be the same for all options.  There will be a single general documentation for communications, and a subsection for the details that differentiate each option.  Should be a little easier.

 - final high speed inter-prop serial channels

High Speed serial from non released V3.6 will be cleaned up in the transition to 4.0.  Documentation and examples. 

 - fl: fixes to FASTLOAD

Change current behavior of loading the source into memory in one pass as a single chunk, and interpreting all the source in a second pass as one chunk.  After months of research, it was determined that the prop has multiple cogs, so a cog could start loading the source, and another cog could start interpreting the source.  Took a while, but we finally noticed.  Consider change in  handling of in-line comments so the input buffer does not overrun when code is followed by a comment on the same line.

=== 2010 July 09 PropForth 3.2 ===

PropForth 3.2 uses descriptive names and a simplified naming convention and achieves the intent described for the not-released version 3.0.  The design and architecture are the same as version 2.7, but the name changes will cause an UNDEFINED WORD error message for code using the old names.  The list of word changes in the README.txt file in the archive

NOTE: The UNDEFINED WORD error can also occur due to a serial overrun.  If you paste in a chunk of code to teraterm and see this error, you should paste smaller sections of text or use the {{{fl}}} (fileload) word

[http://code.google.com/p/propforth/downloads/detail?name=PropForth3.2%2020100710%20archive.zip PropForth3.2 20100710 archive.zip]

should help in updating existing code. 

Some of the files names have changed BACK to old names due to organizational issues.  Therefore the entire version 3.2 file set is posted as a single zip archive.  Please submit questions and requests based on the v 3.2 file set. 

The additional changes listed in version 2.8 will be added at a later date as time permits. 

----

=== Not Released PropForth 3.0 ===

Determined that original design allowing high level forth words to be unique to each cog was overly complex.  As it turns out, any words which need to be custom for a given cog tend to be assembler words.  PropForth 3.0 is planned to be a more standard forth, for example the current word mswHere will be replaced by the standard forth word HERE. No date has been targeted for this release.

----

=== Not Released PropForth 2.8 ===

Plan to add words to support calling forth from spin, and spin from forth. 

Plan to post the disassembler and documentation

Plan to post the ethernet interface

----

=== 2010 May 30 PropForth 2.7 ===

fix bug in saveforth for 64k page eeProm write

Fix key input time out 

Some documentation changes

Decided to start including a downloadable file PropForthX.X.zip to contain all releases files in a single archive.  This will be added when all updates are complete.

NOTE: Documentation changes are in progress
PLEASE send questions, this will help drive the documentation updates

----

=== 2010 May 9 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.6. A number of bug fixes.

----

=== 2009 October 24 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.5. One few bug fix, cogreset issue. eeReadPage and eeWritePage have been modified to support multiple 64kx8 eeproms. eeCopy word was added into the base image.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle. Some minor adds, words to sample at different rates.

float.f - ieee754 floating point routines added, very useful in development, still need to use fixed point math where speed is essential.

----

=== 2009 October 2 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.4. A few bug fixes, and a number of enhancements. Stack over/underflow reporting, the divide is now a mixed divide, 64 bits divided by 32 bits to give a 32 bit remainder and result. This is very useful when scaling prop counters.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle.

----

=== 2009 April 20 ===

Added doc for AddingSerialMonitor and a page for the logic analyzer [La], which is early code (V0.8)

----

=== 2009 April 19 ===

Files uploaded, basics documented, fair bit more documentation required.
