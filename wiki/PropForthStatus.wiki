#summary Status of PropForth
#labels v2.7

=== Planned PropForth 3.0 ===

Determined that original design allowing high level forth words to be unique to each cog was overly complex.  As it turns out, any words which need to be custom for a given cog tend to be assembler words.  PropForth 3.0 is planned to be a more standard forth, for example the current word mswHere will be replaced by the standard forth word HERE. No date has been targeted for this release.

=== Planned PropForth 2.8 ===

Plan to add words to support calling forth from spin, and spin from forth. 
Plan to post the disassembler and documentation
Plan to post the ethernet interface

=== 2010 May 30 PropForth 2.7 ===

fix bug in saveforth for 64k page eeProm write

Some documentation changes

Decided to start including a downloadable file PropForthX.X.zip to contain all releases files in a single archive.  This will be added when all updates are complete.

NOTE: Documentation changes are in progress
PLEASE send questions, this will help drive the documentation updates

=== 2010 May 9 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.6. A number of bug fixes.

=== 2009 October 24 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.5. One few bug fix, cogreset issue. eeReadPage and eeWritePage have been modified to support multiple 64kx8 eeproms. eeCopy word was added into the base image.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle. Some minor adds, words to sample at different rates.

float.f - ieee754 floating point routines added, very useful in development, still need to use fixed point math where speed is essential.


=== 2009 October 2 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.4. A few bug fixes, and a number of enhancements. Stack over/underflow reporting, the divide is now a mixed divide, 64 bits divided by 32 bits to give a 32 bit remainder and result. This is very useful when scaling prop counters.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle.

=== 2009 April 20 ===

Added doc for AddingSerialMonitor and a page for the logic analyzer [La], which is early code (V0.8)

Files uploaded, basics documented, fair bit more documentation required.
