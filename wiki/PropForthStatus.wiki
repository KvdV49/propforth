#summary Status of PropForth

=== Planned PropForth 3.0 ===

Determined that original design allowing high level forth words to be unique to each cog was overly complex.  As it turns out, any words which need to be custom for a given cog tend to be assembler words.  PropForth 3.0 is planned to be a more standard forth, for example the current word mswHere will be replaced by the standard forth word HERE.

Releasing PropForth 2.5. One few bug fix, cogreset issue. eeReadPage and eeWritePage have been modified to support multiple 64kx8 eeproms. eeCopy word was added into the base image.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle. Some minor adds, words to sample at different rates.

float.f - ieee754 floating point routines added, very useful in development, still need to use fixed point math where speed is essential.


=== 2009 October 2 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.4. A few bug fixes, and a number of enhancements. Stack over/underflow reporting, the divide is now a mixed divide, 64 bits divided by 32 bits to give a 32 bit remainder and result. This is very useful when scaling prop counters.

La.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words. Can also sample every clock cycle.
