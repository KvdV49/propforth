#summary Status of PropForth


=== 2009 October 2 ===

Releasing PropForth 2.4. A few bug fixes, and a number of enhancements. Stack over/underflow reporting, the divide is now a mixed divide, 64 bits divided by 32 bits to give a 32 bit remainder and result. This is very useful when scaling prop counters.

lalite.f - a lighter version of La, missing the gui but more power and easily usable in other forth words.

Files uploaded, basics documented, fair bit more documentation required.
