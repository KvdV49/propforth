#summary LIDAR-Lite laser range finder

= Introduction =

LIDAR-Lite was introduced as a kickstarter. This was claimed to be the same performance as the $350 SF02 laser range finder.  Naturally, I was curious, and backed the project.  We can never have too many great sensors. 

However, I am sceptical.  There's no way.  If this does work I will be very pleased.  But the only was to test is side by side.  So here goes.

== Documentation ==

First let me say that the documentation for LIDAR Lite is nasty.  Of all the links on their web site this one

http://pulsedlight3d.com/pl3d/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LIDAR-Lite-Operating-Manual.pdf

is the one one worth anything. 

Lidar Lite guys, please read your site, make the links work.   Thanks!

== I2C ==

LIDAR Lite is I2C or PWM.  While the SF02 can spit readings directly to your serial terminal application, the LIDAR-Lite MUST talk through an external microcontroller.   Fair enough, most folks are going to hook this up to an arduinl, etc. anyway.  But its slower getting started. 

=== I2C address ===

One part of the manual says I2C address is 0x84 another place says 0xC4. So is it 0x84 or 0xC4?  


=== read ===

Manual says:   Read: register 0x0f, returns the upper 8 bits of distance in cm, register 0x10, returns the lower 8 bits of distance in cm. 
(Optionally a 2 ! Byte read starting at 0x8f can be done)
