This is to be covered in Propforth.htm in the download archive.   

The Automated Build and Test functionality introduced in Propforth v5.3 uses a PC workstation to exercise the interactive propforth system.  The workstation will generate the propforth kernels from source, load each kernel in turn onto the propforth standard testbed, and execute the regression test suite. 

The intent is to allow EVERYTHING to be tested every time a change is made. 

Any change to the kernel requires that every known test be run to check if something got broken. This s the only way to ensure that it will behave the same way.  Even so, somethingg can still get broken, this will help catch the most obvious errors.

The automation can create a complete set of kernels in under an hour.  The test suite can execute in under two hours. Compare to doing this process manually, which takes a skilled and experienced operator a couple weeks.
