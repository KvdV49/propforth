#summary GY-80 IMU.

= GY-80 Inertial Measurement unit =

The GY-80 is a very inexpensive 10DOF inertial measurement unit.

I got mine off Ebay for about $50, it was insanely cheap at the time.  Now they are going for about $14.  Be aware that these might be rejects or in some way defective.  They still work and are fun to play with, and are fine for experimentation purposes.  

There are newer parts on the market that are more capable and possibly cheaper.  Some have upgraded versions of these parts, so potentially there are drop-in replacements and the same code works.  CHECK THE DATA SHEET, as always!

= Uses =

IMU is handy for meausuring changes in speed and position (inertia).  If we know speed and direction, we can determine our position in relation to a known point, such as our starting point.  If we have no other information, we can call this "dead reckoning" or "deduced reckoning".

We can use this for Robo-Magellan, or Quad Copter navigation and control. 

NOTE:  GPS is separate from this IMU, we can add GPS later. 

= I2C =

The GY-80 uses  [I2C] bus  to talk with the microprocessor.  There are actually FOUR I2C bus parts on the GY-80. The use the same [I2C] wires and commands that we already se to talk to the EEPROM, so support is already built into the kernel for  free. Neet!

The parts are 
 * ADXL345 accelerometer
 * BMP085 barometric pressure sensor
 * HMC5883L magnetometer (Compass)
 * L3G4200D gyroscope

The accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer all are 3 axis. 

 * [ADXL345]
 * [BMP085]
 * [HMC5883L]
 * [L3G4200D]
