#summary SubVersion (SVN) is an open source version change control system

= Introduction =

UNDER CONSTRUCTION 20110121 -  not ready for use 

In order to perform code review, we need a method to track changes to version of the source code. After the author's initial version, each reviewer will suggest changes, which could result in a new version. After several simultaneous reviews, there could be several conflicting versions.   We need a way to manage which changes from which version are to be kept, and which are to be discarded.  There are many ways to do this, and usually each person does it a different way.  Confusion quickly sets in UNLESS....

The experiment is to attempt to implement SVN as a version control system.  We''ll see if anybody can install it, and if anybody uses it.  IF everybody decides they can't or won't use it, we will try a different alternative.  But we must start someplace, this is as good as any. 

SubVersion (SVN) is the most common open source version control system.  There is another choice which supports off-line check-in, but since I have no idea what that means, I think we don;t need it at this point.  If we find that we do we can switch later. 

= Details =

I downloaded SVN for windows.  I play a lot of video games, and windows is good for video games (if nothing else) and I have a very fast machine with a nice graphics and huge video.   Smarter people will probably use linux, there will be a separate linux page when somebody decides to write it; of course smarter people may not need instructions so there you go. 

Anyway...

http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32svn/

Man-o-man this was a bear.  Maybe I think different than other folks, but I could NOT find the documentation to set this up.  Possibly the docs assume the user has already done this successfully on another system, which is kind of useless, because a person that already knows how would not read the instructions anyway.

Lets see if I can write the steps to set up the repository and connect.

 # Download and install the newest subversion (I used Setup-Subversion-1.6.15.msi)
 # Download and install the newest TortiseSVN (I used XP Explorer  TortoiseSVN-1.6.9.19725-win32-svn-1.6.12.msi)
 # Create the directory you want to use as the local SVN directory on your PC (this is where you will see the files you get from the repository when you work on them. I used G:\Propforth-SVN)
 # ringht click on the directory (G:\Propforth-SVN) and select TortiseSVN > Create Repository Here 
 # Open a Commnd Line in XP using Start > Run > cmd 
 # In XP's command line window,cd to your local repository window: 
   * cd G:
   * cd \Propforth-SVN
 # Checkout the current repository
{{{
G:\Propforth-SVN>svn checkout https://propforth.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ propforth --username your.username@gmail.com
Checked out revision 711.
}}}

At this point, there should be a directory on your local hard drive that is associated with the svn repository.

 # find the repository location on Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/propforth/source/browse/
 # locate the Google Code Repository instructions: http://code.google.com/p/propforth/source/checkout
 # find your Google code password (auto generated by Google code per YOUR login): https://code.google.com/hosting/settings
 # Navigate to your local SVN directoy in windows
 # right click on the svn directory
 # select TortiseSVN >"create repository here"

You should now have a local associated with the SVN Google code repository through TortoiseSVN

At this point, the instructions are general.  You can ADD files to the archive for new development; you can chck out files to modify them; you can check in files after modification is complete.

PLEASE send comments if you see errors.  I tried to take notes as I went through this, but I know I missed some steps.  20110128
