#summary Physical Connection for Prop to SD per Spinneret

= Spinneret SD Configuration =

By Default, Propforth v4.5 uses the Spinneret Pinout for SD.

Please note that SD I/O pins 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 MUST have a 10K pull up resistor. Pin 21 (clock) does NOT have pull up.  Vdd goes to the other end of the pull up resistor, GND does not have a resistor.

That is, one end of the resistor connects to the I/O pin, and the other end of the 10K resistor connects to Vdd.  I use 10-pin resistor packs, there are 9 resistors and one common, the resistor pack pins line up with the connectors on protobosard, the schmart board, and standard solder-less breadboard.

Options are:
  # solder directly to your microSD card
  # solder to a miniSD to microSD adapter (nothing seems to use mini anymore except the Zipit, I used these)
  # solder to a regular SD to microSD adapter (used these, as I have several)
  # solder directly to a regular SD card

Using an adapter is more flexible and does not carry risk of destroying the SD card.


= Pinout for the prop to various format SD cards =

Using the Spinneret connections as the standard,  
make to the following connection per the SD card or adapter you choose.

The following connections must also be present 

{{{
P16  - 10K - Vdd
P17  - 10K - Vdd
P18  - 10K - Vdd
P19  - 10K - Vdd
P20  - 10K - Vdd
P21  - NO PULL UP - P21 directly to clock only
}}}

The I/O pin must also go through the 10k resistor to Vdd
