#summary Add Bluetooth HC06 to Logger1Simple.

= Introduction =

Add the HC04 Bluetooth Cable replacement to Logger1Simple

This allows access to the logger when operating remote from the PC.

=  Step 1 Logger =

Load the SD kernel, with double math, and time support, as described in

Logger1Simple

found in the zip archive on the downloads subpage.

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/downloads/detail?name=Logger-2013-05-12.zip

Note that the time.f etc and other source files are different from the version in the extensions directory, as they have been modified to run from SD and log to SD.

= Step 2 Bluetooth =

Running over bluetooth is straightforward. 

Simply change the serial line assignment from the default (usually prop pins 30 & 31) to the pins assigned to the HC06.  For these demos, I have been using pins 24 and 25, but these can be moved to any available pins.
