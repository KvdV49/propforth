#summary Setup PropForth 6.0 prototype.

= Introduction =

These are the instructions for setting up PropForth 6.0 on a windows PC.

PropForth 6.0 is available to team members.  Contact braino if you want a copy of the zip file.  This is not ready for public release. 

= Windows PC =

For the time being, windows PC is required. We need PROPELLANT to compile the SPIN source files.  Linux support will be included as the tools become available. 

= Set Up GO language =

Set up Go Language according to the instructions.

If you are upgrading from a previous configuration (e.g. from PropForth 5.5) 

In START -> Settings -> Control Panel -> System:

Advanced -> Envirronment Variables -> System Variables:

Create an envirnment varriable HOME.  If there was an environment variable HOME in the USER VARIABLES section (I  think this was per the pf5.5 instructions), remove the definittion from USER VARAIBLES and create a HOME environment variable in System Variable. 

HOME is the location of the Go source files.  My original path may have been created by the Go install, it was in My Documents and had a crazy long path.  These tend to choke if they are too long, so I made my Propforth directory 

C:\PropForth6.0

and the therefore the definition fo HOME is

{{{
HOME  C:\PropForth6.0\
}}}

HOME
