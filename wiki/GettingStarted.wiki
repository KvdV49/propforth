#summary Getting PropForth going.

= Getting PropForth going =

There were no issues with a Propeller proto board, Propeller demo board Rev (F), and homebrew boards, 40 pin prop chips with a 64kx8 eeprom, one at 96Mhz, one at 80Mhz as the target.

There were no isues with TeraTerm 4.63 and 4.65 http://sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/downloads/46035/teraterm-4.65.exe/ with 57.6 kb with 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control, no delays.


  * Download PropForth.spin
  * Compile with the Propeller Tool
  * Load into eeprom 

  * Start up TeraTerm or any other serial driver 
  * Set to 57.6 ks 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control, no delays.
  * Hit enter

Start playing with PropForth. PropForth starts up in hex mode. 

NOTE: Propeller Tool releases the serial port after the load is complete, so TeraTerm can be start without closing Propeller Tool.  However, TeraTerm will keep control of the serial port until the File>Disconnect (Alt-I) command is issued, or TeraTerm is shut down. The Propeller Tool issues the message "Communications Error - No propeller Chip found on serial port" when Propeeler Tool attempts communication with the Prop chip while  TeraTerm still has the serial port.
