= Parts Details =

You can get the parts yourself (to try and save money) or you can order prepackaged kits (to try and save money).  I get a volume discount (therefore and additional break on shipping).  But its a pain in the @$$ and a lot of work and costs money to make these kits.  So I priced it so is just a TAD more expensive if you buy just one kit, and tad less expensive if you buy a whole bunch of kits. 

Buy the parts yourself if you are just doing one for yourself.  You are responsible for getting everything right. 

Buy the kits from me if you are having me do a class or a workshop.  This way I can ensure everything is right.
