#summary Collect data fo thermistor calibration.

= Introduction =

Each batch of thermistors is different.  Within a batch there can be variation. After we add the wires and connect tto tthe final circuit, a given part can end up different from its siblings from the same batch. 

The should help with collecting datta for calibrating thermistors.

= overview =

The thermistor raw data collection package has a bunch of parts:

 # thermistor driver - 
   # read the sensor, 
   # store the data to RAM memory.  
   # Runs on its own cog, in the background
 # logger - write records to SD card memory
   # fetch the actual temperature (as written to RAM)
   # fetch the last sensor reading (as stored to RAM)
   # format the record,  write to SD
   # Runs on its own cog, in the background
 # GUI - 
   # prompt the user for input (temperature the thermistor is experiencing)
   # collect input from the operator, store to RAM memory 
   # display the status of the process (temperature, reading, in-progress, READY)
   # launched by user
   # runs on the cog6, the user cog, in the foreground
 # Boot routine
   # this load the other source files
   # this launches the routines on the other cogs
   # this switched user input to bluetooth by deafult
   # this allow the user to interview, and prevent the input switch to bluetooth.  This is needed so we can run connected to the PC if desired. 
 # time
   # this is optional
   # we don't need to know or track the time. but its often handy to have timestamps
   

== Thermistor driver ==

This source code is loaded first.  It sets up 
  * the thermistor PIN 
  * the thermistor HUB RAM memory location
  * the thermistor driver routine

== GUI ==

This source code is loaded second.  It sets up 
  * the thermistor PIN 
  * the thermistor HUB RAM memory location
  * the thermistor driver routine

The gui routine asks the user for current temperature the thermistor is experincing.  This is typically from a known good instrument, such as lab thermometer or a bench thermometer.   Other sources of known temperature are:
  * boiling water (100C)
  * icewater (0C). Use crushed ice in an insulated mug etc.
Boiling and freezing are the high and low points for my data range, so far

== logger == 

This code is loaded third. 
  * defines the logger routine
  * needs to have the LOGGED variable defined

The logger sits in a continuous loop.  When it detects that a numeric value has been entered and stored in the HUB RAM location, it begins logging.

The logger logs:
 * a text label for temperature 
 * the temperature in degrees C as entered by the user
 * a text label for readings
 * one or more reading from the thermistor
 * a carriage return (so the flog file displays properly
