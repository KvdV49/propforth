#summary A full school year class using LittleRobot
#labels v5.5

= Introduction =

The Full year class for Fall 2013 to Spring 2014 is the first attempt at a full school year duration class for LittleRobot. This is a follow on for the LittleRobot Pilot, find that page by filtering fo "deprecated" in this wiki. 

The intend is to establish a class that can be administered by school staff directly, and involve little or no direct participation from the propforth team (if possible).

It tentatively looks like the propforth team will have to give at least internet based support to the teaching staff.
