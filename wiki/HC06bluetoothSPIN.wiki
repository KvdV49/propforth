#summary Using a SPIN utility to configure virgin HC06.

= Introduction =

The HC06 bluetooth modules have been finicky to configure.

If the forth scripts don't success, the spin script shuld, and vice versa.

All be need to do is 
 *  Set an approprate unique name
 * Set the baud rate to 230400

= The HC06 defaults =

Usually the HC06 comes with these defaults (per datasheet)

  * Name: livnor
  * Baud: 9600

A recent batch has the name: FBT06

= SPIN Utility to congifure HC06 =

OBC at PropellerPowered.com offer BlueToothHelper.SPIN

If you are using the LittleRobot pin assignments, the Bluetooth Tx pin is 26 and the Bluetooth Rx pin is 27.  Edit BluetoothHelper.spin as follows:

 # Open BlueToothHelper.SPIN in the propeller Tool 
 # Change line 29  
{{{
  BT_TX_PIN     = 26 ' 0 
}}}
 # Change line 30  
{{{
  BT_RX_PIN     = 27 ' 1 
}}}
 # Change line 47 
{{{
  VG_PIN        = 0 ' 16  we don't want vga on pin 16 of quickstart  
}}}
 # Change line 48 
{{{  
  KB_PIN        = 4 ' 26  we don't wnat Keyboard on pin 26 of QS, thats our pin   
}}}
 # Save the file 

Continue in the Proptool to load BluetoothHelper.spin into the Quickstart EEprom.

 # connect the Quickstart to the USB serial cable 
 # load  BluetoothHelper.pin into EEprom (F11)

After the Load to EEprom process is complete, you should be able to verify communication and configure the HC06

 # start teratem, ensure the baud rate is set to 9600
 # connect the Bluetooth module
 # hit the reset button on the Quickstart.  The Bluetooth Helper interface should be dispalyed in the teraterm window
 # send the ` AT ` command.  The response should be ` OK `

NOTE: This is the finicky part. If you r do not see OK, something is not communicating. DO NOT PANIC. OK, panic a little, but this is easy to fix.  Check some stuff until you figure it out.  Or CALL ME.  Take it slow, you'll figure it out.
