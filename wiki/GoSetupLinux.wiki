= Go channels set up for Linux =

Thing about Linux is there are a lot of ways the various installs can be different.  Rick got his it run just fine on a standard PC install. Braino is having some issues with the Fedora version on the OLPC XO. 

This page is to collect all the steps specific to Linux, to determine what goes wrong in the Fedora install.

These are the notes distilled from the items referenced below 

 == steps from post 57 ==

Speaking of Linux, I go things running there without major effort or problems.

 # I skipped over all the emacs stuff. I use GEDIT with a termial tab at the bottom.
 # Install the new Go package as instructed by the folks at golang.org (I ended up putting my Go in /opt/go)
 #  I downloaded the mygo.zip from the PropForth downloads and unzipped it into my code directory (/home/rapost/code/go)
 #  I updated my .bashrc as follows:
{{{
export GOROOT=/opt/go
export GOPATH=/home/rapost/code/go:/home/rapost/code/go/mygo 
}}}  - at this point, I bounced out of and back into terminal to get all my settings how I wanted them
 #  cd to my code directory /code/go/mygo and was able to run goterm and gomuxterm without problems.
 #  I know, please write it up for the wiki (*got this covered!*)
