= Go channels set up for Linux =

Thing about Linux is there are a lot of ways the various installs can be different.  Rick got his it run just fine on a standard PC install. Braino is having some issues with the Fedora version on the OLPC XO. 

This page is to collect all the steps specific to Linux, to determine what goes wrong in the Fedora install.

These are the notes distilled from the items referenced below 

 == steps from post 57 ==

Speaking of Linux, I go things running there without major effort or problems.

 # I skipped over all the emacs stuff. I use GEDIT with a termial tab at the bottom.
 # Install the new Go package as instructed by the folks at golang.org (I ended up putting my Go in /opt/go)
 #  I downloaded the mygo.zip from the PropForth downloads and unzipped it into my code directory (/home/rapost/code/go)
 #  I updated my .bashrc as follows:
{{{
export GOROOT=/opt/go
export GOPATH=/home/rapost/code/go:/home/rapost/code/go/mygo 
}}}  
 # at this point, I bounced out of and back into terminal to get all my settings how I wanted them
 #  cd to my code directory /code/go/mygo and was able to run goterm and gomuxterm without problems.
 #  I know, please write it up for the wiki (*got this covered!*)

   === Questions ===

 * GEDIT : How to set up a terminal tab in the bottom 
 * GEDIT : How to add GO (the extension .go) into the list of program source?
 * GEDIT : Or do we use C highlighting, how to associate .go with that?
   
  under preferences -> Plugins -> Active Plugins checked the box for External Tools.  Under Configure Plugin I see Build, Open Terminal (Do I go in here everry time I need a terminal, or is there a way to get this in the menu?) Remove trailing spaces, Run Command.

Opening Run Command -> Applicability [...] brought up a language selection window, and the XO froze.  The mouse moves and the seconds on the clock update, but no other response. Could not shut down, removed battery. 

  === Answers ===

 * GEDIT Terminal Tab

After checking box for External Tools (and a forced restart in my case),  the Tools Menu has the option "External Tools".  This contains options Build, Open Terminal Here, Remove Trailing Spaces, Run command. 

Checking the "Run Command -> Applicability [...]" issue again, the same thing happened.  This time, I tried the power button, this put the XO into sleep mode.  When it came back up, it was still in the "mouse and clock only" state. 

Holding the power button for several seconds got a full shutdown, restart came up working with no windows o applications running. 

Note to self -  don't try "Run Command -> Applicability [...]" till its fixed. 

   * GEDIT : Adding GO .go extension to list of identifed languages

   * GEDIT : go context highlighting

  === Summary ===

{{{
export GOROOT=/opt/go 
export GOPATH=/home/rapost/code/go:/home/rapost/code/go/mygo 
}}}

GOROOT=/opt/go ; this is directory where GO was INSTALLED

GOPATH=/home/rapost/code/go:/home/rapost/code/go/mygo 
; the first GOPATH is your home directory for your go source code, 
; the second GOPATH is to the mygo directory containing the 
; propforth MCS/go channel interface support package

using OLPC XO, which linux 386 fedora.

Install is to 
/usr/local/go 
per the instructions at http://golang.org/doc/install

Code is at 
{{{
/home/oplc/Code/Gocode 
}}}
(per your example, which makes more sense than the instruction I posted)
This has the bin, pkg, and src from the mygo download.

The instructions indicate that only the PATH needs to be set so in .bashrc I have:
{{{
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export GOPATH=/usr/local/go/:/home/oplc/Code/Gocode
}}}
the environment variable from "go env"
{{{
GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
}}}
Hello.go will compile and run, but

"go install goterm"

gives the message
{{{
# runtime/cgo
exec gcc: exeec: "gcc": executable file not found in $PATH
}}}
I tried including various paths in HOME, PATH, GOROOT, and GOPATH, but no luck, and I'm just hacking now.

   === Questions ===

Do we need PATH set for Go in Linux?
What does PATH need to be set to? 
Is GOROOT set automatically?
What other environment variables need to be set, are they set automatically?

Does Go need GCC?
Does the error message say the GCC is NOT installed?

My go env gives this:
{{{
[rapost@C3PO go]$ go env
GOROOT="/opt/go"
GOBIN=""
GOARCH="amd64"
GOCHAR="6"
GOOS="linux"
GOEXE=""
GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
GOHOSTOS="linux"
GOTOOLDIR="/opt/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64"
GOGCCFLAGS="-g -O2 -fPIC -m64 -pthread"
CGO_ENABLED="1"
}}}
If I do "which gcc", I get this:
{{{
[rapost@C3PO go]$ which gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
}}}
If I do "which gccgo", I get this:
{{{
[rapost@C3PO go]$ which gccgo
/usr/bin/gccgo
}}}
I'm trying to find out if there's a way to get a verbose listing of the install to see what's actually happening.

It's strange that the simple program works but something in the more complex fails.
