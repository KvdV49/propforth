= Go channels set up for Linux =

Thing about Linux is there are a lot of ways the various installs can be different.  Rick got his it run just fine on a standard PC install. Braino is having some issues with the Fedora version on the OLPC XO. 

This page is to collect all the steps specific to Linux, to determine what goes wrong in the Fedora install. 

= Linux instructions =

These are the notes distilled from the items referenced below 

 == steps from post 57 ==

Speaking of Linux, I go things running there without major effort or problems.

 # I skipped over all the emacs stuff. I use GEDIT with a termial tab at the bottom.
 # Install the new Go package as instructed by the folks at golang.org (I ended up putting my Go in /opt/go)
 #  I downloaded the mygo.zip from the PropForth downloads and unzipped it into my code directory (/home/rapost/code/go)
 #  I updated my .bashrc as follows:
{{{
export GOROOT=/opt/go
export GOPATH=/home/rapost/code/go:/home/rapost/code/go/mygo 
}}}  
 # at this point, I bounced out of and back into terminal to get all my settings how I wanted them
 #  cd to my code directory /code/go/mygo and was able to run goterm and gomuxterm without problems.
 #  I know, please write it up for the wiki (*got this covered!*)

   === Questions ===

 # I see gedit.  
   * How to set up a terminal tab in the bottom 
   * How to add GO (the extension .go) into the list of program source?
   * Or do we use C highlighting, how to associate .go with that?
   
  under preferences -> Plugins -> Active Plugins checked the box for External Tools.  Under Configure Plugin I see Build, Open Terminal (Do I go in here everry time I need a terminal, or is there a way to get this in the menu?) Remove trailing spaces, Run Command.

Opening Run Command -> Applicability [...] brought up a language selection window, and the XO froze.  The mouse moves and the seconds on the clock update, but no other response. Could not shut down, removed battery. 

  ==== Answers ====

After checking box for External Tools (and a forced restart in my case),  the Tools Menu has the option "External Tools".  This contains options Build, Open Terminal Here, Remove Trailing Spaces, Run command. 

Checking the "Run Command -> Applicability [...]" issue again, the same thing happened.  This time, I tried the power button, this put the XO into sleep mode.  When it came back up, it was still in the "mouse and clock only" state. 

Holding the power button for several seconds got a full shutdown, restart came up working with no windows o applications running. 

Note to self -  don't try "Run Command -> Applicability [...]" till its fixed.
