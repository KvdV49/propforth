#summary Setting Up Raspberry Pi for GO and PROPFORTH
#labels RPi,RaspberryPi
= Introduction =

Raspberry Pi is the BASELINE platform LINUX installation for the propforth build and regression test automation. 

This system will also serve as the basis for a workstation OS node in multiprop configurations.

Even if you don't want to do automated kernel builds and or automated regression testing, you still want to stet this up.  This is what turns a couple microcontrollers into .... something interesting.

= set up =

These notes are taken from Sal's dokuwiki raspberry pi notes and are subject to change.  Report any errors and I'll try to fix 'em.

== Install RASPIAN on Raspberry Pi SD ==

These images were tested and worked

Follow the directions to burn this to the SD

== Power up the RPi ==

At initial boot, a configuration screen will come up on the RPi. Select and execute the following options:
{{{
expand_rootfs
change_timezone
memory_split - select the option which allocates the most memory for ARM
ssh - enable ssh
finish - answer yes to rebooting 
login as pi (default password in raspberry)
}}}

If you want to run the configuration again

raspi-config:

{{{
sudo raspi-config
}}}
== set your password ==

Change the password for the user pi:
{{{
passwd
}}}

== set hosttname and IP address ==

Now we are going to change the IP address to be a static address, and we are going to change the hostname. Depending on your LAN configuration these addresses may be different.

{{{
sudo nano /etc/hosts
}}}
Change:
{{{
raspberrypi
}}}
to:
{{{
rpi-my-unique-name
}}}
(or whatever you want the hostname to be).

And add the following line (the ip address is the static address we will set later):
{{{
192.168.0.170 rpi-my-unique-name

sudo nano /etc/hostname
}}}
Change:
{{{
raspberrypi
}}}
to:
{{{
rpi-my-unique-name
}}}

(or whatever you want the hostname to be).
{{{
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
}}}
Change the line:
{{{
iface eth0 inet dhcp
}}}
to:
{{{
iface eth0 inet static
}}}
And add the following lines:
{{{
address 192.168.0.170

netmask 255.255.255.0

gateway 192.168.0.1
}}}
And reboot the system:
{{{
sudo reboot 
}}}
to allow the changes to take affect

= Run HEADLESS =

This step is optional.  You don't HAVE to run headless, but the little RPi is faster if it doesn't have to mess running with a GUI.  These steps apply to your windows PC.

== install Xming ==

Xming works really well but its a little funcky to set up.  Folks who use Xming assume everybody understand everything about Xming, which make is a bit problematic for new folks. 

The idea is that Xming talks through PuTTy and lxterminal and lets us SSH into terminal windows on the RPI.  If you don't understand, that's ok, it doesn't matter at this point. Here's what matters:

  # Start Xming - Xming Launch
 # Select Multiple Windows - Next>
  # Select Start a Program Next>
  # Start Program: lxterminal (replace 'xterm' with 'lxterminal'

Don't hit Next yet.  In the same window: 

 # Run Remote
  # Select Using PuTTy (plink.exe)
 # Connect ot computer: IP.Address.of.RPi (this is IP address you put in /etc/hosts on the RPi
  # Login as user: pi (unless you changed it)
 # Password (raspberry or whatever you set)
  # Next>
 # next> (nothing gets selected on the additional parameters page
  # Finish

It takes several seconds for the systems to negotiate ssh passwords and whatever else they do to introduce themselves.  Eventually if all is well you get a command window on the RPi.   You are not working remotely on your RPi from your WXP PC.  

Navbigate to the instructions pages on the PC browser and cut and paste the instructions into the RPi terminal window.  Its alot easier, and you are less prone to typing mistakes.
