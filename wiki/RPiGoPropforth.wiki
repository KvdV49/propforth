#summary Setting Up Raspberry Pi for GO and PROPFORTH
#labels RPi,RaspberryPi
= Introduction =

Raspberry Pi is the BASELINE platform LINUX installation for the propforth build and regression test automation. 

This system will also serve as the basis for a workstation OS node in multiprop configurations.

Even if you don't want to do automated kernel builds and or automated regression testing, you still want to stet this up.  This is what turns a couple microcontrollers into .... something interesting.

These notes are taken from Sal's dokuwiki raspberry pi notes and are subject to change.  Report any errors and I'll try to fix 'em.

== Install RASPIAN on Raspberry Pi SD ==

These images were tested and worked

[http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/download.php?file=/images/raspbian/2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian/2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian.zip 2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian.zip]

Follow the directions to burn this to the SD

== Power up the RPi ==

At initial boot, a configuration screen will come up on the RPi. Select and execute the following options:
{{{
expand_rootfs
change_timezone
memory_split - select the option which allocates the most memory for ARM
ssh - enable ssh
finish - answer yes to rebooting 
login as pi (default password in raspberry)
}}}

If you want to run the configuration again

raspi-config:

{{{
sudo raspi-config
}}}

Change the password for the user pi:
{{{
passwd
}}}
Now we are going to change the IP address to be a static address, and we are going to change the hostname. Depending on your LAN configuration these addresses may be different.

{{{
sudo nano /etc/hosts
}}}
Change:
{{{
raspberrypi
}}}
to:
{{{
rpi-my-unique-name
}}}
(or whatever you want the hostname to be).

And add the following line (the ip address is the static address we will set later):
{{{
192.168.0.170 rpi-my-unique-name

sudo nano /etc/hostname
}}}
Change:
{{{
raspberrypi
}}}
to:
{{{
rpi-my-unique-name
}}}

(or whatever you want the hostname to be).
{{{
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
}}}
Change the line:
{{{
iface eth0 inet dhcp
}}}
to:
{{{
iface eth0 inet static
}}}
And add the following lines:
{{{
address 192.168.0.170

netmask 255.255.255.0

gateway 192.168.0.1
}}}
And reboot the system:
{{{
sudo reboot 
}}}
