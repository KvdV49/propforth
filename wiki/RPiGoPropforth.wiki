#summary Setting Up Raspberry Pi for GO and PROPFORTH
= Introduction =

Raspberry Pi is the BASELINE platform LINUX installation for the propforth build and regression test automation. 

This system will also serve as the basis for a workstation OS node in multiprop configurations.

Even if you don't want to do automated kernel builds and or automated regression testing, you still want to stet this up.  This is what turns a couple microcontrollers into .... something interesting.
