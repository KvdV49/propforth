= setup =

Connect the Quickstart to the PC with a USB cable

After the device is registered, 

== Load a kernel ==

highlight the entire contents of the files (CTL^A)

copy it (CTL^C)

paste it into the teraterm winodw with the propforth command line (right mouse)

= Using LAC =

== load an application (Quickstart touch demo) ==

== load lac.f after application ==

== set triggers ==
