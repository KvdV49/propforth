#summary The first session had five kids

We were advised that the kids should start playing as soon as possible.

To do this, we skipped showing the boring set up stuff, and went directly to the experiments

The setup was:

Window Laptop with PropTool, Mac Laptiop with BST

Download propforth archive

Load Devkernel.spin

Download teraterm (Windows), coolterm (mac)

Connect the Quickstart to the USB port on the laptop (notice the first time drive install)

verify the green LED lights, and teh propforth command prompt dispays

Show the kids how to connect the quickstart (with devkernel.soin loaded into EEPROM) to  the USB port

Verify the Green LED

= Hello World =

Instruct the kids to type in:

{{{
: greet ." Hello World " ;

greet
}}}

The kids all did something like

{{{

: billy ." burritos give me gas ooh yeah " ;
}}}

Success!

To  move on, have the kid teach the next kid to do the same

Instruct the kids to play with:

{{{
