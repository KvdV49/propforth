#summary Blinky LED is traditionally the second program
#labels LittleRobot,v5.5,Deprecated

= Why Blinky LED =

The most difficult part about getting stated is simply controlling an IO pin. In the old days this way a big deal. 

= Prerequisites =

The following needs to be in place to play this game: 

   * PC
   * Proptool
   * tereaterm
   * propforth

See GettingStartedWithPropForth

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/GettingStartedWithPropForth
   
= Start =

After you have followed the instruction in GettingStartedWithPropForth,  you should understand and perform the  following 

  * Turnon the PC
  * Connect the Qucikstart 
  * Start Teraterm 
  * Verify the Green LED on the Quickstart board
  * Verify the propforth command prompt

= Blinky LED =

Point out the LEDs are by P16 through P23

== a single LED ==

Instruct the kids to play with:

{{{
16 pinout
16 pinhi
}}}

CHECK - DID the blue LED by P16 turn on after you typed `16 pinhi`?

{{{
16 pinlo
16 pinin
}}}

Have them turn on various combinations of LEDs

== Sequence of LEDs ==

*do ... loop* 

Using pinout pinhi pinlo delms i +

Have kids make an LED flash on for 100 ms, and flash on for 500 ms, using do loop

Leader decided to make LEDs flash once in increasing order ` i 16 +`

Second leaded decided to make them flash again in decreasing order `23 i - `

Remember to include ascending and descending LEDs for the rest of the class


{{{
: outs 8 0 do i 16 + dup . pinout loop ;

: forward 8 0 do i 16 + pinhi 200 delms  i 16 + pinlo loop ;

: backward 8 0 do 23 i -  pinhi 500 delms  23 i - pinlo  loop ;

}}}

= EXPLANATION:=

`delms` is DELAY for MILLISECONDS.  Milliseconds is represented by the value on the stack.  100  milliseconds is 1 seocnd, 1 millisecond is too quick to see. 

What is the smallest number of milliseconds you can see? 

What is the Largest number of milliseconds you can use? How long does THAT take? 

How to stop the delms early? Hint: its easier than you thought.

Defining a "word" begins with a COLON *`:`*

After the colon is a blank space.  Colon means "take the letters after the space, until the next space, and make that the name of my routine". 

The "word", in this case `greet`, is the name or identifier for the word.

The definition of what the word does is any sequence of valid forth words.  

The first FORTH word is dot-double-quote *`."`*

*`."`* (dot-double-quote) says "start making some text".  After `."` (dot-double-quote) is a space, and then a bunch of text. 

`."` (dot-double-quote) is ended by one double quote *`"`*

One double quote `"` says " I'm done making text".

The semi-colon *`;`* ends the word definition.  This marked the end of the definition started by the colon. 

NOTICE!!!!! If you make a typo, FORTH DOESN'T try to guess that its a mistake.  FORTH is not smart, and trusts you to tell it to do what you want.  IF YOU MAKE A TYPO, hit the *black reset button* on the quickstart and start again.  This might seem awkward at first, but later it becomes very powerful.
