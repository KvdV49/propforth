#summary Blinky LED is traditionally the second program
#labels LittleRobot,v5.5

= Why Blinky LED =

The most difficult part about getting stated is simply controlling an IO pin. In the old days this way a big deal. 

= Prerequisites =

The following needs to be in place to play this game: 

   * PC
   * Proptool
   * tereaterm
   * propforth

See GettingStartedWithPropForth

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/GettingStartedWithPropForth
   
= Start =

After you have followed the instruction in GettingStartedWithPropForth,  you should understand and perform the  following 

  * Turnon the PC
  * Connect the Qucikstart 
  * Start Teraterm 
  * Verify the Green LED on the Quickstart board
  * Verify the propforth command prompt

= Blinky LED =

Point out the LEDs are by P16 through P23

== a single LED ==

Instruct the kids to play with:

{{{
16 pinout
16 pinhi
}}}

CHECK - DID the blue LED by P16 turn on after you typed `16 pinhi`?

{{{
16 pinlo
16 pinin
}}}

Have them turn on various combinations of LEDs

== Sequnce of LEDs ==

EXPLANATION:

Defining a "word" begins with a COLON *`:`*

After the colon is a blank space.  Colon means "take the letters after the space, until the next space, and make that the name of my routine". 

The "word", in this case `greet`, is the name or identifier for the word.

The definition of what the word does is any sequence of valid forth words.  

The first FORTH word is dot-double-quote *`."`*

*`."`* (dot-double-quote) says "start making some text".  After `."` (dot-double-quote) is a space, and then a bunch of text. 

`."` (dot-double-quote) is ended by one double quote *`"`*

One double quote `"` says " I'm done making text".

The semi-colon *`;`* ends the word definition.  This marked the end of the definition started by the colon. 

NOTICE!!!!! If you make a typo, FORTH DOESN'T try to guess that its a mistake.  FORTH is not smart, and trusts you to tell it to do what you want.  IF YOU MAKE A TYPO, hit the *black reset button* on the quickstart and start again.  This might seem awkward at first, but later it becomes very powerful.
