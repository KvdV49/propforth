#summary The first session had five kids
#labels LittleRobot,v5.5

= Introduction =

We were advised that the kids should start playing as soon as possible.

To do this, we skipped showing the boring set up stuff, and went directly to the experiments

The setup was:

Window Laptop with PropTool, Mac Laptiop with BST

Download propforth archive

Load Devkernel.spin

Download teraterm (Windows), coolterm (mac)

Connect the Quickstart to the USB port on the laptop (notice the first time drive install)

verify the green LED lights, and teh propforth command prompt dispays

= Start =

20130426

Show the kids how to connect the quickstart (with devkernel.soin loaded into EEPROM) to  the USB port

Verify the Green LED

Verify the propforth command pompt

= Hello World =

FIX HERE

Instruct the kids to type in:

{{{
: greet ." Hello World " ;

greet
}}}

The kids all did something like

{{{ 
: tommy ." I like mcdonalds " ; 
: billy ." burritos give me gas ooh yeah " ;
}}}

Success!

To  move on, have the kid teach the next kid to do the same

=  LED 1 =

Point out the LEDs are by P16 through P23

Instruct the kids to play with:

{{{
16 pinout
16 pinhi
}}}

CHECK - DID the blue LED by P16 turn on after you typed `16 pinhi`?

{{{
16 pinlo
16 pinin
}}}

Have them turn on various combinations of LEDs

Success!

To  move on, have the kid teach the next kid to do the same

= Notes =

For this session, all the kids had to work from one PC

After 45 minutes, some of the kids started to drift away, starting with the youngest more or less.  Take a break after 45 minutes.

= FORTH PROGRAM SYNTAX =

When we make our own programs:
  * Each forth word starts with colon `:`
  * The new word has a unique name identifier
  * Each forth word ends with a semicolon `;`
  * If the word does more than about 7 things, its probably too long.
  * If the word does less than about too things, it might be too short

= words up till today =

These are the FORTH words introduced so far:

|| word || name || stack note || used for || terminator ||
|| pinout || pin-out || ( n - )||  make a pin an output || space ||
|| pinhi || pin-high || ( n - )||  make a pin a logically high Vdd || space ||
|| pinlo || pin-low || ( n - )||  make a pin a logically low Vss || space ||
|| pinin || pin-in || ( n - )||  make a pin an input || space ||
|| :   || colon || (identifer - ) || starts a new word definition || semi colon ; ||
