#summary Throughput number for MCS
#labels v5.2.1BETA

= Introduction =

PF521BETA is testing the affects of the buffer size and number of channels on throughput. 


= Details =

We think there are two main factors that affect throughput

 # Number of CPUs on the workstations side
 # size of the buffer for each channel on the prop side.

At the current configuration, COG6 has 1K of its RAM allocated to buffer for the MCS Go-channels. This 1k is divided among the channels that COG6 is serving. COG6 watches the data stream, and send bytes to the buffer for each channel.  The cog on the watching the buffer consumes them as then appear, and spits characters back out. COG6 takes these and sends them back out on the data stream. 

 * A single channel has 1K buffer
 * 4 channels would have 256 bytes each
 * 8 channels have 128 bytes each
 * 16 channels have 64 bytes each
 * 32 channels have 32 bytes each

= Test Setup =

Please capture the numbers of CPUs when gomuxterm is launched

= Test commands =
PFv5.2.1BETA includes a test function to exercise the MCS serial for loopback, send and receive.  CONTROL-C launches the test menu. 

{{{
CONTROL PANEL
h       - prints help
?       - print status
q       - disconnect

nn c    - connects to channel nn as a telnet connection (CTL-c will invoke CONTROL PANEL)

n1 n2 s - run a loopback speed test on channel n1 for n2 bytes -- 4 <= n1 <= 32, 100 <= n2 <= 10000

n1 n2 t - run a send speed test on channel n1 for n2 bytes (data from prop) --  0 <= n1 <= 3, 100 <= n2 <= 10000

n1 n2 u - run a receive speed test on channel n1 for n2 bytes (data to prop) --  0 <= n1 <= 3, 100 <= n2 <= 10000
}}}

These are the test functions we want to run on all configurations. Send 5000 character over the channels, determine characters per second.
