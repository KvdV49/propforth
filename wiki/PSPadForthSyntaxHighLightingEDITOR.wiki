===Highlighterr Settings ===

CHECK PropForth (at the bottom of the left panel list by the <NOT ASSIGNED>)

On the COLORS tab select colors sufficiently different to make the keywords stand out

On the specification tab adjust the name oand the file extensions to be associated with this color scheme. 

===User Hightlighter===

CHECK {...} for fastload comments

CHECK (...) \ for end of line comments

In the TAB 1, 2, 3, 4 

Add your application's defined words to TAB 4;  or move the default kernel words to re-organize the coloring as needed


= using PSPad =

Forth text should now appear with appropriate highlighting

= NOTE= 

I could not get small words 

{{{
W! W@
L! L@
C! C@
EE! EE@
}}}

To color properly.  If anybody figures this out pleas post or PM me so I can update this (and fix my rig)
