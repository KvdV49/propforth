#summary Options for an interface to the LittleRobot

= Introduction =

An important part of the !LittlRobot software is the user interface.  The user interface allow us to communicate with the robot, to tell is what to do and get reports its responses. 

= terminal interface =

The simplest user interface to the !LittleRobot is to use the !PropForth command line.  An sequences of forth words may be executed from the command line. A PC or laptop running a terminal program will be sufficient.  Typically, a !PropForth stem will b tethered to a PC via USB cable during development.

== Wired: TeraTerm ==

During development, it is recommended to use Teraterm or other terminal program.

== Wireless: BlueTerm ==

Blue Term is a free android app for Terminal over bluetooth.  It behave pretty much the same as a wired terminal setup.  With a clear line of sight on a clear day, Blueterm has functioned up to 100 feet.  Beyond the range of the bluetooth devices, the transfer rate decrease sharply, and errors begin to become noticiable, of course. 



= Application interface =

A final application will typically require a custom application interface.  Rather than the user choosing from the entire set of forth words, the application will present specific words in specific context, to perform a given application.  The goal is to make it simple for the user to send the necessary commends and receive back the required information. 


== Android App ==

The !LittleRobot Prroject includes plans for an Android App that packages functions for communicating with the !LittleRobot.
