#summary Using Propforth with Linux

= Introduction =

There's a couple ways.  I use Ubuntu 12.04 and run a virtualbo windows xp session.


= Install Linux =

If you have an old PC, the hardware might not accept 12.04 directly.

Using a KT600a motherboard, I had to install 11.04 first, then upgrade.

Notice: if you are coming from Windows, the keyboard numeric keypad might behave oddly. If you prefer to have the keypad behave as in Windows:

  Applications > System Tools> System Settings

  Keyboard Layout > Layouts > Options 

  > Miscellaneous comp[compatibility options

    *Shift with Numeric keypad works as in MS Windows*

= install Virtual Box =

In the Ubuntu software center, Virtual Box 4.1.12 is offered, but this doesn't work.

Go to the developer site 

https://www.virtualbox.org/

and get 4.2 (4.2.4.2. 8 is what I used)

http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.8/virtualbox-4.2_4.2.8-83876~Ubuntu~precise_i386.deb

= Install Windows =

Be sure you have a valid license

= install Guest extensions = 

Launch the Oravle Virtual Box application.

Under Devices, select Install Guest applications

Allow the software to install, and reboot

 == Optional: 3D accelleration ==

  Restart Windwos virtual machine in SafeMode

  Again select install Guest Additions

  This time it will let you select enable 3D accelleration

  Allow the software to install and reboot


= Allow USB =

You will have gotten a bunch of messages saying USB is not captured, and mouse is captured.   Now we set up USB and get rid of the nag screens.

Notice that you have to shutdown the windows virtual machine for this step.

Shutdown the Windows Virtual Machine.

In Oracle VirtualBox Manager > Settings > USB 

  Verify that Enable USB Controller is checked

  Also check Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) controller

An error warning pops up, that is OK. 

Restart the w9ndows virtual machine 

  Start ->

Another warning comes up about auto capture keyboard, check "Do not show this again" and hit OK

The virtual machine should now be able to see the USB device when you connect your propplug, Quickstart, etc.

= Map linux drirectory so Windows can see it =

Devices > Shared Folders

Navigate to your Public directory. Map it as Read Only

== Optional: Writeable ==

Bfronm linux:

Under your Public directory:

Make a subdirectoy name "Writable" or something

Give this one full access

*This dierectoy is so yu can send stuff bback out to linux from windows. The Public directoy is read only in case something bad gets in through windows, it will limit its affect (maybe).* 

= Install Proptool =

Be sure to get version 1.3.  Note that Googling for parallax propeller proptool tends to bring up version 1.2.7 (R2) (or at least it used to, this is not the right version.

As of this writing, I notice there is a version 1.3.2, I will be trying that.
