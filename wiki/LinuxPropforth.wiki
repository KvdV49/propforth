#summary Using Propforth with Linux

= Introduction =

There's a couple ways.  I use Ubuntu 12.04 and run a virtualbo windows xp session.


= Install Linux =

If you have an old PC, the hardware might not accept 12.04 directly.

Using a KT600a motherboard, I had to install 11.04 first, then upgrade.

= install Virtual Box =

In the Ubuntu software center, Virtual Box 4.1.12 is offered, but this doesn't work.

Go to the developer site 

https://www.virtualbox.org/

and get 4.2 (4.2.4.2. 8 is what I used)

http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.8/virtualbox-4.2_4.2.8-83876~Ubuntu~precise_i386.deb

== Install Windows ==

Be sure you have a valid license

= Install Proptool =

Be sure to get version 1.3.  Note that Googling for parallax propeller proptool tends to bring up version 1.2.7 (R2) (or at least it used to, this is not the right version.

As of this writing, I notice there is a version 1.3.2, I will be trying that.
