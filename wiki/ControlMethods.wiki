 * State machine
 * PID 
 * Kalman Filter
 * Fuzzy Logic

= State Machine =

When the inputs are in this state, set the outputs to this state.

Account for all the states that will happen. 

Some state MIGHT happen but don't.

Some states SHOULDN'T happen but DO 

= PID =

Smoothly adjust to avoid over shoot and oscillation

Google: Proportion Integral Derivative
