 * State machine
 * PID 
 * Kalman Filter
 * Fuzzy Logic

= State Machine =

When the inputs are in this state, set the outputs to this state.

Account for all the states that will happen. 

Some state MIGHT happen but don't.

Some states SHOULDN'T happen but DO 

= PID =

Smoothly adjust to avoid over shoot and oscillation

Google: Proportion Integral Derivative

Nick Lordi presented us with this work in forth.

= Kalman Filter =

= Fuzzy Logic =

WE can do a si9mple type of fuzzy logic in propforth.  

Logical FALSE is defined as ZERO. (All bits zero)

Logical TRUE is defined as -1 . (All bits ONE)

Any non-zero values alue evaluates as True. 

We can use this for fuzzy logic.  For example, by assigning the most influential factors to higher bit positions,  we do GREAT-THAN and LESS-THAN COMPARISON instead of just EQUALS comparison.    This comes out like  "more true" and "less true".  You get the idea.
