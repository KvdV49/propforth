= Introduction =

This outlines the default design decisions for Propforth.

= Propforth Kernel = 


  The default propforth kernel will run on ANY Propeller chip.  No additonal hardware is required.  Any propellor chip that is capable of accepting a spin file will run propforth. 

== default hardware configuration ==

The default hardware configuration for propforth is the default configuration per the Parallax Propeller data sheet.

    === 32 K EEPROM ===

    The minimum hardware required for a propellor chip to function usually includes a 32K EEPROM.  Therefore, the default kernel is designed to run using a 32K EEPROM. 

    The EEPROM is attached to pins 28 and 29 per the default hardware specification. 

    === Serial Terminal ===

    The default serial terminal connection is on pins 30 and 31. 

== Extension Options for the basic hardware configuration ==

The basic hardware includes the bare prop chip, and one 32k EEPROM.  This configuration is expanded for most projects and applications. 

    === 64K EEPROM and greater ===

   The initial configuration for the propchip can be extended to use EEPROM larger than 32K.  Typically EEPROM is expanded to 64K.  The standard default kernel is compatible with 64K and larger EEPROM.  The EEPROM can be expanded to any size addressable by the prop chip.  If an address is given, the kernel will attempt to access it.  It is the responsibility of the user/developer to ensure the physical EEPROM is present, and handle any errors appropriately. 

   === Alternate Serial Terminal ===

   The default serial terminal on pin 30 and 31 is defined by the prop chip boot process.  After booting is complete, pin 30 and 31 may be used for other purposes, and a serial terminal may be configured on any available pins.   

    Alternative serial terminals are NOT included in the default kernel. Alternative serial terminal configurations are the responsibility of the user/developer. 

   === VGA ===

   The VGA support extension follows the VGA configuration on the Parallax Demo Board by default.  This may be moved or modified by the user/developer by changing the pin assignment in the source code.  The last release of propforth that specifically contained VGA support was v3.6 JupiterACE HiResVGA and LowResVGA.   Support will be re-added to v5.0 when the assembler optimiztion work is complete. 

   === Keyboard support === 

   The Keyboard support extension follows the  Keyboard configuration on the Parallax Demo Board by default.  This may be moved or modified by the user/developer by changing the pin assignment in the source code.  The last release of propforth that specifically contained  Keyboard support was v3.6 JupiterACE HiResVGA and LowResVGA.   Support will be re-added to v5.0 when the assembler optimiztion work is complete. 

   === Mouse Support ===

Mouse support has not been implemented at this time.  It is left to the user/developer to implement mouse support as needed. 

   === TV ===

   TV support has not been added to the default kernel or the default propforth package as this time.   As of version 4.5, work is underway by propforth users to implement TV support.  This may be added to the default propforth download archive upon completion. 

   === Ethernet support ===

   Ethernet support is according to the Spinneret Board configuration.  This is equivalent to a wiznet w5100 module connected to a prop protoboard according to the spinneret datasheet and schematic.   However, Prof_Braino has not gotten his w5100 and protoboard to behave like a spineret board; but this is large due to me not taking the time to check the wiring. 

   === SD support ===

   SD support is according to the Spinneret Board micro SD card slot configuration.  Other pin configurations as needed are left to the user/developer.  One typical option is to use a micro SD to full size SD adapter, and turn it into a micro SD slot. 

== Hardware not supported by the default kernel  ==

The following hardware support is not included in the standard kernel.  These items are left to the user/developer to implement as needed.  Any implements provided by users/developer can be added to the download archive when completed.   All contributions are welcome. 

   === audio support ===

   === SPI support ===

   === Expanded RAM support ===

   There are several options for expanded RAM on the prop chip and none has been accepted as "standard".   Therefore, propforth does not include any "standard" expanded RAM support.  It is left to the user/developer to implement this support as needed. 

   === RC support ===
