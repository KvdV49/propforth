#summary Instructions for Automated Build and Test in Propforth v5.5.

= Introduction =

The Automated Build and Test will be improved to make more parts automatic.

In v5.5, certain steps still have to be done by hand, by Sal.  These are creating the symgen file, and doing  parts of the assembler optimization for the kernel. 

Sal intends to make this less "magic" and more "documented"

= Preparation =

# Setup the PC for Propforth

  * Download the Proptool
  * install the proptool
  * install the USB drivers
  * verify the USB drivers are working (by loading and executing a spin program)

# Find the build automation

  * download the propforth 5.5 archive
  * extract the archive
  * find the mygo.zip
  * extract the mygo.zip
  
# Set up the automation

  * Install the Go Language support
  * rebuild GoTerm 
  * rebuild GoMuxTerm

# Configure the automation
  
  * Set up the environment variables
  * ensure the correct starting directory

# Run the automation
 
  * Verify the build automation (make.bat)
  * Verify the test automation (test.bat)
  * Run the full automation (maketest.bat)

# Check the logs for Errors

  * if error level is not 0 something did not match
  * back trace to determine the cause of the error. 
  * correct the cause of the error, and update any tests. 
  * save the correct results are the reference results for next run.
