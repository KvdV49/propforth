= Introduction =

Spinneret (wiznet5100 compatible) is one way to get Ethernet access to a prop system.  Originally, spinneret was the only way. 

Other methods are becoming easier and cheaper (Go channels on PC or Raspberry Pi); and spinneret is becoming less optimal. 

However, we already have it in place, so spinneret support will continue to be packaged with the propforth download for the time being. 

= Spinneret support =

Th Ethernet support for spinneret is big in terms of resources required.  It takes up most of the prop memory, leaving little left for user application words.  

= Using Spinneret with Propforth =

The solution chosen was to run scripts from SD.  Almost any SD card provides enough space to allow web pages of any size and complexity. 

However, Propforth on the spinneret is not something that a beginner can set up and get running in five minutes. One has to be very aware of what to do when and why to make it work.  

For this reason, the Spinneret support is no longer present in the "CurrentReleases" directory as of version 5.3.   Th spinneret support is still present, but is left in the "results" directory

for experienced developers.
