= Introduction =

WE decided to have an expert translate the LittleRobot instructions from Geezer Talk into Kid-Speak.

Vic found some kids (assorted nephews and nieces, one going to U of I). 

Yes, this was written for kids, and written by actual kids.  I was purposely kept away until they were finished. 

The results are under review.
