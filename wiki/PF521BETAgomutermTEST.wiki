#summary Outline for testing PF5.2.1BETA GoMuxTerm.
#labels v5.2.1BETA

= Introduction =

PropForth v5.2.1 BETA was sent to team members and various frequent users. We want folks to beat on this, particularly the serial connections, to see if they hold up or show any differences from what we expect.  We hope they will be identical to previous behavior, with the addition of having many channels instead of just one.  

The serial channels don't have any particular regression test suite, as the serial channel is the most basic communication and is assumed to be working in the first place. So the best way to test changes to the serial channel is just to start using it.  Sal didn't see any smoke, but we will only know for sure when users put it through its paces and determine that its the same of different. 

= Requested Tests = 

Sal would like to get some throughput data on the various configurations on the various rigs that people use. The BETA has a Test menu that we can access using 
{{{
control C
}}}
from the command prompt.  We can launch some loop back and throughput tests, and collect the numbers to see if they look like we expect. 

= Set up =

NOTE: This only applies to BETA testers with PF v5.2.1BETA.  If you want to try the BETA (its fast and fun!) email me or post to the parallax boards or PM me and I'll email you a copy. 

  == Set up PF v5.2.1BETA ==

 * Unpack the archive to your hardrive as usual
 * Using PropTool load the kernel to you propboard Unit Under Test (UIT)
{{{
\propforth\Propforth-V.5.2.1-20120519\CurrentRelease\PropForth\PropForthDevFastSerialKernel.spin
}}}

Verify you can get a SERIAL connection to `COG6` using Telnet as usual, your comport, 230400 baud.  Notice the executing `words` is REALLY fast now!

Close the TeraTerm comport session after you know the prop is loaded and working.

NOTE: If you try to make a TELNET connection at this pint, you will get a `connection refused` message, as `gomuxterm` is not running yet. 

  == Setup new version of 'gomuxterm' ==

This uses the same installation of 20120420mygo.zip, with a new `/src` directory.

In your `mygo` directory (i.e. C:\Documents and Settings\Boss\My Documents\GoFiles\mygo),

RENAME the `src` directory to something like `src.old`

 * unpack the new `2012May19-mygo.src.zip`
 * copy the `/src` directory to your `mygo` directory
 * enter the /src directory 
 * make the /src/serial directoy contains the correct file for your OS (windows is default)

 From a Windows command prompt, recompile goterm and gomuxterm

 * Start-> Run -> cmd
 * cd C:\Documents and Settings\Boss\My Documents\GoFiles\mygo
 * run the goshell.bat script
 * recompile goterm and gomuxterm

{{{
go install goterm
go install gomuxterm
}}}

NOTE: If you get the message 
{{{
can't load package: package goterm: import "goterm": cannot find package
}}}

it means that goshell.bat was not executed, and the go environment has not been set up.  Check that goshell.bat is being run

 == New parameter for goterm and gomuxterm  ==

OK, goterm has the same parameters as before.  Check it still works but running goshell.bat and using

`goterm com5 230400`

You should see that go term permit command history functions provided by the os. 

Now try gomuxterm.  The parameter string has changed to include the number of channels (8, 16, 32, and possibly 4) and a flag for debug mode, 0 is OFF

`gomuxterm com5 230400 8 3000 4000 0`

Notice that we used 8 for the number of channels. The request for testing is to try the different values 8, 16, 32 (and 4 if it works) on your machine. 

You should see:
{{{

 == Whats going on (short version) ==

COG6 is listening to gomuxterm, and go muxterm is listeming to port 4000.

COG6 is using 1K of COG RAM as a buffer for 8 channels (channel 0 through channel 7)
