#Most of the differences from DPANS94 forth standard

= Why there are differences =

In cases where the DPANS94 standard could not be followed, propforth will deviate from the standard.

The design decisions made attempt to achieve a compromise on execution speed, code size, and simplicity.  

= CREATE =

The PropForth CREATE word behaves differently from the standard.
