= Introduction =

Logger 2 demo is similar to Logger 1 demo: Once each second, a record is collected

Record contains:
 * time and date text stamp,
 * CNT register (hex), 
 * 64 bit time value, 
 * unix time

Difference is after midnight, a new log is created if it does not exist. New log file size is based on buffer size and logging frequency. Log file may have one block extra due to rounding.
