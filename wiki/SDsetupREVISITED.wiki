#summary Set up SD for Propforth.

= NOTICE =

You MUST have the PULL UP RESISTORS or it won't work.  Do I have you attention?  See below for the pull up resistors you must have.  Or it won't work.   Did I mention it won't work without the pull up resistors?

== SD CARD tabs ==

The SD card tabs are the little gold contacts on the SD card.  Some folks call these pins but they are not pins. At least they don't look like pins to me, so I will call them TABS.  I will use PINS to refer to the I/O pins p0 through p31 on the propeller chip.  

== SD card connections ==

Set up an SD card or SD adapter per

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/PropToSDconnection

I'm using a full size SD adaptor as a card slot for microsd cards.

Looking at the bottom of the Full size SD adaptor with the gold tabs facing up and at the top of the card, the truncated corner is at the upper left. This is DAT2 and is usually numbered TAB9


From Left to Right the tabs are

|| 9 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |  |    
|| DAT2 | CS | DATIN | VSS1 | VDD | CLK | VSS2 | DATOUT | DAT1 |  |
|| ss | MOSI | GND | 3.3V SCK | *NC* | MISO | *NC* | *NC* ||

or 

|| PIN  || SPI function || Prop Pin || description || Pull Up resistor? ||
|| Pin9 || nc || P18 || not used in SPI mode || Pull Up resistor optional ||
|| Pin1 || CS || P19 || Chip Select || Pull Up resistor- YES ||
|| Pin2 || DI/MOSI || P20 || description || Pull Up resistor - YES ||
|| Pin3 || Vss1 || P-Vss || GND ground || Pull Up resistor- no ||
|| Pin4 || Vdd || P-Vdd || 3.3 volts ||Pull Up resistor - (YES) ||
|| Pin5 || Sclk || P21 || Serial Clock || Pull Up resistor - no ||
|| Pin6 || Vss2 || P-Vss || GND ground || Pull Up resistor - no ||
|| Pin7 || Do/MISO || P16 || description || Pull Up resistor - YES ||
|| Pin8 || nc || P17 ||not used in SPI mode  || Pull Up resistor optional ||
