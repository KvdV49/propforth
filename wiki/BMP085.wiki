#summary BMP085 temperature and pressure sensor, used as altimeter

= BMP085 =

The BMP085 barometic pressure sensor

https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/en/homepage/products_3/environmental_sensors_1/bmp085_1/bmp085

is present on the GY-80 10DOF IMU.

The BMP085 communicates using I2C, SCL an SDA, same as the EEPROM already present on the prop boards. 

= I2C connection =

Looks pretty simple. 

* 3.3v to 3.3v
* GND to GND
* SCL to SCL
* SDA to SDA

The I2C bus has unique ID for each device. If we can talk to the EEPROM ((i.e  f the prop boots from EEPROM) the I2C bus is working.   If we use the correct slave ID for the BMP085 ($0x77) we should be talking to the device using the same routines as for EEPROM. EEPROM support exists in all PropFORTH kernels, we don't need to use the EEPROM file system kernel unless we want the EEPROM file system.

Also, if we can talk to the BMP085, we should also be able to talk to the other divces on the GY-80, which are the HMC5883L magnetometer, the ADXL345 accelerometer, and the L3G4200D gyroscope.
