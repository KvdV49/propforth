== BIG CHANGES in V5.0 ==

General descriptive text at the start of the file

 * hexadecimal characters must be uppercase

 * xABD will be interpreted as hex no matter what the base is

 * d1234 will be interpreted as decimal no matter what the base is

 * there is an optional line buffer mode which will not echo characters until cr is hit

 * backspace x08 is used, del x7F does not delete a character in the buffer

 * CR x0D is the line termination, LF x0A is not a line termination

 * CR is ouput as x0D, setup teraterm to receive CR+LF, and to transmit CR - _this was done to allow redirection of files easily to and from IO_

 * kernel modified and optimized

 * added ST@ ST! - _fast instructions to access and modify stack_

 * more assembler instructions can be dynamically added

 * assembler words are now dynamically loaded and cached - _this provides huge optimizations and space efficiency_

 * There are a few spin constants which allow the modification of:
  # tx pin
  # rx pin 
  # baud rate
  # cog used for the console serial driver
  # which cog starts up forth
