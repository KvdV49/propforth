#summary A stab at conventions for forth source code files

= A Method to Keep Organized =

Source code can quickly get out of control.

Here are some guidelines for keeping control of forth source code

= What we need to know =

For a given set of source code definitions

We need to keep track of:

 # the version of the source
 # What the code does
 # What order to load the source definitions
 # What order to execute the definitions

== the version of the source ==

 Tag the version using an arbitrary sequence number, and a date time stamp.

 MyFunction-2.2-20101128-1709.f

 Would be Forth source code file ({{{*.f}}} )

 For a function called MyFunction (as assigned by the author)

 version 2.2 (arbitrarily assigned by the author, where the previous version was 2.1 or lower)

 Date-time 2010 year 11 month (November) 28 day - 17 (5 PM) 09 minutes after the hour.  If you have a case where you need seconds, go ahead, but that usually is too much resolution.
