#summary A stab at conventions for forth source code files

= A Method to Keep Organized =

Source code can quickly get out of control.

Here are some guidelines for keeping control of forth source code

= What we need to know =

For a given set of source code definitions

We need to keep track of:

 # the version of the source
 # What the code does
 # What order to load the source definitions
 # What order to execute the definitions

== the version of the source ==

 Tag the version using an arbitrary sequence number, and a date time stamp.

 MyFunction-2.2-20101128-1709.f

 Would be Forth source code file ({{{*.f}}} )

 For a function called MyFunction (as assigned by the author)

 version 2.2 (arbitrarily assigned by the author, where the previous version was 2.1 or lower)

 Date-time 2010 year 11 month (November) 28 day - 17 (5 PM) 09 minutes after the hour.  If you have a case where you need seconds, go ahead, but that usually is too much resolution. 
 

== What the code does ==

 The name of the function should be descriptive enough to convey what the code is intended to accomplish 

 names prefixed with an underscore designate a function used internally by the kernel; these can have side affects that may not be obvious.  These words should not be called from other location aside from those intended by the author.

== entry / exit criterion ==

 all code must iinclude clear documentation for entry and exit criterion.

 We need to know:

 what circumstances must be present before the code is called.  
 What circumstances will be left after the word is finish executiong

 STACK NOTES 
- all words MUST define what they expect on the stack in order to function.  
- all words MUST define what they leave  on the stack after they function.  

 INITIALIZE VARIABLE

In cases where variables are used, all variables must be identified.
The set of Valid values for each variable must be identified
The set of invalid values for each variable must be identified

== What order to load the source definitions ==
 
== What order to execute the definitions ==
