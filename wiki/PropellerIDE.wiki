#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

WE still need SPIN to load the PropFORTH 5.5 kernel.

My last windows box died, so I can no longer use PropTool

PropellerIDE can load SPIN from linux 

= Hardware =

PC - I'm using Linux Mint 17 (MATE) 64 bit

Propeller - I'm using a Propeller Quickstart for this experiment

= Software =

FRom the follwoing ling, select the download for your system:

https://lamestation.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PI/Downloads 

I selected : propelleride-0.19-amd64.deb 

Close the browser, you are done with it.

Open a terminal

navigate to your downloads directory (shown is FIRFOX's default)

{{{
cd Downloads
}}}

In the terminal window, type the command:

{{{
sudo dpkg -i propelleride-0.19-amd64.deb
}}}

Get an error that saying libftdi1 is not installed.  Ignore this and continue with:

{{{
sudo apt-get install -f
}}}

At this point, you can type 

{{{
propelleride
}}}

in any terminal window, and the prop IDE will launch.

I created a launcher so I can click instead of type:

Right click on PANEL

select + Add To Panel

select Custom Application Launcher

[Create Launcher Type: Application]

Name: PropIDE

Command: Browse: (navigate to /usr/bin/propide )

When Prop IDE opens, it will ask you to select a location to save Welcome.spin

I created directory named *prop* in my home directory, this is a likely choice.
