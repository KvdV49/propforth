= Introduction =

WE still need SPIN to load the PropFORTH 5.5 kernel.

My last windows box died, so I can no longer use PropTool

PropellerIDE can load SPIN from linux

https://lamestation.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PI/PropellerIDE+Home

The icons on this page do not launch the download.  (Clever! Tricked did you?)

The [[https://lamestation.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PI/Downloads | LEFT Panel has a downloads]] link

I selected : propelleride-0.19-amd64.deb 

Open a terminal

navigate to your downloads directory (shown is FIRFOX's default)

{{{
cd Downloads
}}}

Instructions say 

`After downloading, run:`

{{{
sudo dpkg -i propelleride-0.19-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
}}}

Get an error that saying libftdi1 is not installed
