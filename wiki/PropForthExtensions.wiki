#summary Extensions to the PropForth Kernel
#labels v4.5,v5.0

= Introduction =

These are the !PropForth Extensions.  A section is to be added explaining  each extension listed.  Typically a given application will not need all extensions.  The user/developer chooses the extensions suitable for the application, and only those need to be added.  This saves on memory footprint, and program complexity.  This is roughly analogous to other environments where only the necessary functions are selected at compile time to be compiled into the application; the difference is that in FORTH the user plays a greater role in selecting the functions and at what point a given extension is added.

= Kernel Extensions =

  == Boot Kernel ==

  The Boot Kernel is the bare Forth Kernel.  Sometimes the bare kernel is defined as the smallest unit of Forth that can read an write memory.  In PropForth, the bare kernel is defined as the smallest unit that is able to re-generate the Propforth.spin file. 

 The Boot Kernel is generally used AFTER development is complete (all the applications code is finalized).  This is typically in stand alone turnkey applications that do NOT need the interactive forth command prompt included in the final aaplication. 
  
  == Development Kernel ==

  The development kernel is an interactive command line interface to the propforth kernel.  It contains developmer extensions that are most commonly used in experiments and application development.  For example, the following words (forth routines) are included by default to aid in development:

  * words - display all the words (forth routines) currently in the forth dictionary
  * st? - displays the contents of the stack, 32bit longs in hex
  * decimal - converts the cogs number base to decimal
  * (add more examples here) 

  Also, sparse and verbose diagnostic messages are included for common functions.   Examples are:

  * cogs reset messages   
  * stack underflow messages
  * stack overflow messages
  * divide by zero messages

  Many internal functions do NOT include error code displays by default, handling these are the responsibility of the developer.
 
  * Memory range violations
  
  Best practice is to write extensions such that they operate in the development kernel, but do not require development kernel functions.  This way, extension can be used with the BOOT KERNEL in turnkey final applications (that do not include the forth development environment). 

  Extensions that are for development should be identified as * development extensions * and dependencies noted.  The reason is that is development and final extensions are mixed during development, there is a risk that something will break when the app is finalized. Generally, there is little time for these error at the end of the project, it is best to address this earlier when their is sufficient time to understand and correct problems. 

=  EEPROM Extensions =

The EEPROM is one of the few pieces of external hardware required by a forth system.  The default kernels provide support for reading and writing EEPROM as individual bytes, and as pages (see datasheet).  

Currently the Demo Board comes stock with a 32k EEPROM, which is entirely used to hold the prop boot image.  This minimum 32KEEPROM cannot be used to store additional data on a prop application that is to be rebooted (writing to EEPROM will step on the boot image and that causes problems).  The prop protoboard and most other include stock or upgradeable 64k EEPROM.  The additional storage can be used to store additional data beyond the boot image.  Propforth includes extensions to tuse the additional EEPROM as a rundimentary "file storage system". 


    == EEPROM READ-WRITE File system ==

  The Read-Write File system allows the developer to put files into EEPROM memory and access them.      The EEPROM file system allow read, write, delete of text files and data.

    ==  EEPROM READ-Only File System ==

  After the EEPROM memory is loaded, often it is desirable to "protect" the files in EEPROM memory. Loading the lower 32k with a kernel and READ-ONLY EEPROM file system gives a degree of confidence that the EEPROM image will not be affected by inadvertent file operations.  HOWEVER, since the default kernel does have support to modify individual byte/pages of EEPROM, the possibility remains (which usually means you have a bug in your code). 

    == Temporary Write Capability for Read Only File System ==

  During development, it is often necessary to modify the contents of the READ ONLY files system until it becomes stable.  In this case, usually the READ-Only files extensions are added to the kernel, and the kernel image is saved to prop lower 32k (saveforth).  The temporary write extensional are added to the dictionary, the files are written, and the prop is rebooted.  This allow changes to the READ Only file system contents in a more controlled manner.  

= Software Logic Analyzer Extension =

The software Logic Analyzer (LAC) is is a tool for sampling and displaying the state of the Propeller chips 32 I/O pins.  

The sample rate is controlled by setting the LAC props sample frequency. 

There are three main LAC configurations:

 * Sample at every 1 clock (Prop frequency, full speed) to COG memory 
 * Sample every 4 clocks maximum to ...
 * sample every ... clocks to HUB memory 

Sampling to cog memory is faster, but only allows 2K max of data sampling

Sampling to Hub memory is slower, but allows a maximum of 32K of samples.

Sampling may trigger on rising edge, falling edge, or middle of transition.

LAC may be configured for sampling to trigger based on a pin state.

LAC may be configured for sampling to trigger based on a complex set of pin states.
