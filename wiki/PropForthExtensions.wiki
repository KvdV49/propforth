#summary Extensions to the PropForth Kernel
#labels v4.5,v5.0

= Introduction =

These are the !PropForth Extensions.  A section is to be added explaining  each extension listed.  Typically a given application will not need all extensions.  The user/developer chooses the extensions suitable for the application, and only those need to be added.  This saves on memory footprint, and program complexity.  This is roughly analogous to other environments where only the necessary functions are selected at compile time to be compiled into the application; the difference is that in FORTH the user plays a greater role in selecting the functions and at what point a given extension is added.

The extensions are on the list but have not seen any code presented to the public.  As you can see, most extensions beyond the kernel are only plans at this point (20110710).  When the kernel is complete, adding support for a given hardware should be a simple matter of reading the datasheet and writing the driver.

= Kernel Extensions =

  == Boot Kernel ==

  The Boot Kernel is the bare Forth Kernel.  Sometimes the bare kernel is defined as the smallest unit of Forth that can read an write memory.  In PropForth, the bare kernel is defined as the smallest unit that is able to re-generate the Propforth.spin file. 

 The Boot Kernel is generally used AFTER development is complete (all the applications code is finalized).  This is typically in stand alone turnkey applications that do NOT need the interactive forth command prompt included in the final aaplication.
