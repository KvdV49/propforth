#summary Hints on Learning PropForth

= Get Started =

Load propforth into EEPROM

Try to make it crash

hit the hardware reset whenever you get an error

= There's no help command! =

Look at these documentation pages

Ask questions, the documentation evolves according to user participation. I try to answer questions within 24 hours, unless they are hard, then I ask Sal on the Sunday call, and post Sunday afternoon.

= Aren't there any real books I can read? =

Yes, the most recommended forth books are

STARTING FORTH by Leo Brodie

THINKING FORTH by Leo Brodie

These are available online as PDF and/or HTML (I will add links later but I'm trying to post this for somebody right NOW)

= I want to try FORTH on my other machine = 

PYGMY FORTH from Frank Sargent is my favorite on a PC type machine.  It is just like FORTH Inc's polyFORTH from the old days.  It runs crazy fast on the slowest machine you can find. 

TOM ZIMMER has great forth for the pc but it is the opposite of forth in that that team tried to prebuild a library of every pssoible function that anybody could ever want, which is cool, but very confusing due to the huge volume of material to learn.
