= LittleRobot(tm) Workshop =

LittleRobot(tm) Workshop is a single 4 hour session.  This presents the intro to embedded control systems material.  This session uses the Parallax Propeller microcontroller, the LittleRobot(tm) kit, and a PC.  

The goal is to have participants assemble the kits and the expected result is a mobile roboitc platform that moves and can sensor the environment in a simple fashion.

= Preparation =

Required for the event are:

   * Internet Access
   * Electrical Power
   * sufficient workspace (two seats per participant)
   * LittleRobot(tm) kits
   * Parallax Propeller Quickstart board (or equivalent)
   * Optional: Bluetooth device:
     * Blue tooth equipped PC or Laptop
     * Blue tooth equipped smartphone
     * Bluetooth equipped tablet

The bluetooth connection is for wireless communication with the LittleRobot.  The Bluetooth equipped device must be capabile of running a Bluetooth terminal application as descripbed below in "software".

= SOFTWARE =
 
User must have permissions to install the required software and drivers on the PC.

== PropForth ==

The primary software tool for this propect is PropForth. PropForth is an implementation of the FORTH language and development environment for the Parallax Propeller micro controller. Please location the downloadable archive for propforth on the sites download section at

== PC OS ==
  
A suitable PC operating system must be loaded. Current options are Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Participants are responsible for familliarity fwith their operationing system of choice. 

=== Windows ===

The primary choice is  Windows XP.  Other version of windows also work. 
The software required for windows systems are:
    * Proptool v1.3.2 (link)
    * Teraterm 4.77 or higher (link)
    

=== Mac OS ===
 
Mac OSX is recommended for Mac users.  Other version may work but have not been tested.
     * Brad's Spin Tool (link)
     * Cool_term (link)

=== Linux ===

Ubuntu 12.04 is recommended for Linux users.  Linux users are required to know how to "get it working" on there own system.  Typically, anyone that uses linux is able to do this. Minimal support for linux operating system will be provided. 
    * SimpleIDE (beta)
    * minicon (link)

== Android ==

To use the wireless communication on an android device, and suitable bluetooth terminal program is needed.  

BlueTerm is the recommend android bluetooth terminal application. Blueterm is available via the App store. The user is responsible for installing  the bluetooth application on the android device of choice. 

== IOS ==

To use the wireless communication on an IOS device, and suitable bluetooth terminal program is needed.  

(none specified) is the recommend IOS bluetooth terminal application. (none specified) is available via the App store. The user is responsible for installing  the bluetooth application on the IOS device of choice. 

= SETUP =

Install teh PC software per your operating system as describled above. The installation process will install teh proper drivers for connecting the Prop Quickstart. 

== INSTALL PROPTOOL ==

In this document, Proptool specifically refers to Proptool v1.3.2 on Windows XP.  Unless otherswise notes the same instruction is to be applied to Brads Spin Tool (BST) on the Mac, and SimpleIDE (BETA) on linux.

Installing Proptool (and BST, and SimpleIDE) will also install the requireed USB to serial driver needed for communicationg with the Quickstart via USB Cable

== Install the TERMINAL Program ==

In this document,  "terminal program" refers to Teraterm on Windows, Cool Term on Mac, and Minicom on Linux. 

== Bluetooth termainal Program ==

To use the optional wireless communication via Bluetooth, a Bluetooth capable terminal program must be available. 

=== PC or Laptop ===

On a Bluetooth equipped PC or laptop, the previously installed terminal program is sufficient. 

Teraterm, Cool_term, and Minicom all see the Bluetooth connection abnd treat is as "just another serial port".  Handy!

=== Android ===

Install Blueterm

Before blueterm can communicate with the LittleRobot, the proper blue tooth module must be connected and the driver software install, as detailed below.   This is fun, we will get to it, be patient. 

=== IOS ===

We have not determined the IOS bluetooth terminal application to recommend as of this writing 20130524.  This item is still under test. ANY Bluetooth terminal program should be sufficient. We just haven't decied which to recommend.
