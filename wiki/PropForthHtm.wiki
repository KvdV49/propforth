!PropForth.htm is the primary reference for learning and using propforth.  It contains explanation and examples for all the functions of propforth.

<wiki:toc max_depth="9" />

 = NOTICE =

This is a COPY. The version in the current download is the correct version.

Notice:  Making Propfoth.htm appear in the google code wiki is problematic.  It takes a bunch of tedious editing that consumes valuable time.  Must find a better way to do this. 

OK, I just put the file as another download

NOTICE that the graphics from section 5 do not display.  This is just for reference, please download the Propforthv5.5.zip archive and extract the file from there to you PC, to display the file correctly.
