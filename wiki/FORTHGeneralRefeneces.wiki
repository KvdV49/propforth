= Introduction =

FORTH is Chuck Moore's personal tool for getting his work done.  Other version of forth vary somewhat from this (these), but still can be considered forth.

There are formal definitions and standards of forth, these are optional.  The closer one adheres to a standard the easier it is to talk to other folks about your work.  But a standards compliant forth tends to be less tailored to the hardware and /or task at hand. 

Here are some common references regarding forth.  These represent examples of the main directions forth and propforth can take.  This is nowhere near a complete list, but should give you a hint of where to get started.
