However, the instructions were Sal's "notes"  during development

You mission, should decide to accept it, is to help re-write the notes in a form the regular people can use.  However, if you do not accept this mission, you will self destruct in five seconds. Good luck.

This is a set of Sal's regression testing the he performs each time he updates propforth. 

Please notice, these are the critical "Highlights" that show the final results.  He does a LOT more during development.   So, some of the steps that are "obvious" are left out.  Unfortunately for you and me, these steps are not so obvious.   So lets re examine this to see what we can see.
