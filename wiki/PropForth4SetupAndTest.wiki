#summary Tutorial on Getting  Propforth 4.0 running
#labels v4.0

= On this version, Instructions are in the README file =

However, the instructions were Sal's "notes"  during development

You mission, should decide to accept it, is to help re-write the notes in a form the regular people can use.  However, if you do not accept this mission, you will self destruct in five seconds. Good luck.

=  What's in the Readme file =

This is a set of Sal's regression testing the he performs each time he updates propforth. 

Please notice, these are the critical "Highlights" that show the final results.  He does a LOT more during development.   So, some of the steps that are "obvious" are left out.  Unfortunately for you and me, these steps are not so obvious.   So lets re examine this to see what we can see.

README.TXT - analysis
Lines  1-36  - description of release.  Useful to read.  
Lines 37-80  - HARDWARE configuration.  
               Optional, kernel runs on all prop chips
               line 39 descriptin for testbed MASTER - proptoboard
               line 40 description of testbed SLAVE  - P8X32A-D40
               line 41 description of spineret ETHERNET - 

SLAVE prop and SPINERET are optinal, I don't have my spineret yet, so I'm only adding SLAVE

               line 43 - safety resistors install these if using optional hardware       

= TEST HARDWARE = 

== MASTER ==

Line 49  - Use any prop chip with a 5Mhz crystal and a 64K or greater EEPROM.  This specifically used a stock protoboard.  This is the chip that we load the spin image into eemrom, a will be talking to via PC serial port termial program

== SLAVE ==

Line 52 - This can be any prop chip. It does NOT need and EEPROM, in fact, for this experiement, it probably should NOT have any EEPROM, as we wnat to emulate the salve's eeprom.  This test configuration specifically uses a 40 pin dip P8X32A-D40. 

== Physical Connections ==

=== MASTER to SLAVE ===

==== EEPROM Emulations and Synchronous serial connection =====

Initally, this connection is use for the MASTER to emulates the EEPROM for the SLAVE, so the MASTER can send over a copy of his code when the slave boots.  

AFTER the slave is booted, this same connection is used as the high speed synchronous serial connection.  

Line 53 - The SLAVE NEEDS a .1 uF capacitor between power and ground RIGHT NEXT to the chip.  Don't ask me why, I don't know, I just follow instructions. 

Line 55 - connect a 10K resistor between SLAVE PIN 38 ( I/O port P29 ) and Vdd +3.3 volts.  This pin will ALSO connect to the master in the next step

Line 58 - Protoboard MASTER P8 connects thru a 220 ohm resistor to DIP40 Pin 37 ( I/O Prot P28) 

Line 59 - Protoboard MASTER P9 connects thru a 220 ohm resistor to DIP40 Pin 38 ( I/O Prot P29) This pin also has the 10K pull up to Vdd

Line 60 - Protoboard MASTER P10 connects directly (no resistor) to DIP40 Pin 11 ( RESn RESET) This is just a straight wire.   OK, it probably bends a little, mine did.

Line 61 - Protoboard MASTER P11 connects directly (no resistor) to DIP40 Pin 30 ( XI Crystal input) This is just a straight wire.   OK, it also bends a little, mine did.

==== secondary asynchornous serail connections ====

Line 63 - This is a secondary serial connection.  

=== MASTER to SPINERET ===

I don't have my spineret yet.  I skipped this for now 20101205
