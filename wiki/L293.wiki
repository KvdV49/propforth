#summary L293 H-bridge.

= Introduction =

An H bridge is allows a small logic level signal to control DC of greater voltage and current. 

Using L293 with the prop, we can use the prop 3.3 volts at a few milliamps to control power to a DC motor.  The L293 four half H-bridge can control two DC motors, and both are reversible.

= Quick Demo =

The Quickstart Touch Demo http://code.google.com/p/propforth/downloads/detail?name=QuickstartTouchDemo20120611-1540.txt is a handy place to start.

When the resistive touch pads on pins 0-7 are touched, the LEDS on pins 16-21 are lighted.  The output pins are set high to light the LEDs.  These can also be used to control the L293 inputs.
