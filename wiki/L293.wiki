#summary L293 H-bridge.

= Introduction =

An H bridge is allows a small logic level signal to control DC of greater voltage and current. 

Using L293 with the prop, we can use the prop 3.3 volts at a few milliamps to control power to a DC motor.  The L293 four half H-bridge can control two DC motors, and both are reversible.

= Quick Demo =

The Quickstart Touch Demo http://code.google.com/p/propforth/downloads/detail?name=QuickstartTouchDemo20120611-1540.txt is a handy place to start.

When the resistive touch pads on pins 0-7 are touched, the LEDS on pins 16-21 are lighted.  The output pins are set high to light the LEDs.  These can also be used to control the L293 inputs.

Load propforth 5.5 to the Quickstart per the instruction in the archive.

Load the Quickstart touch demo to the prop following the instructions in the demo.

Verify the LEDs light when the touch pads are touched.
