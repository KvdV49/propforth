= Introduction =

This page presents an inital logging package for propforth v5.5

The logger logs to SD.  It provides a date - time stamp, bases on the count of microseconds since system startup. 

This package does not include queues

The logger package is available as a downloadable archive in the downloads section of this site.

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/downloads/detail?name=Logger-2013-05-12.zip

= Braino's Note =

This logging package seems like it might be kind of important.  Its very simple, very accurate, and very high resolution. It does not require any special hardware or circuitry, aside from the SD slot.

This is on the list as the center an activity after Little Robot get stabilized.  I think the logging package is going to be really big in terms of popularity and usefulness.  Get started now!

= Requirements =

To use the logger, all that is needed are:

  * a prop board with an SD slot
  * an SD card - see
    * http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/PropToSDconnection
    * http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/SDsetupREVISITED
  * the propforth SD file system kernel (SDKernel.spin in the propforth download)
  * some data to log

= the sections =  

The logger is presented in four modules.

  * Double Math
  * Time
  * Logger Init
  * Logger Boot

== Logger init ==

Logger init just creates a big file on the SD

== Logger Boot ==

Logger Boot loads the Double Math and Time support, and starts the microsecond timer. 

== Double Math ==

The time module needs double math, as it tracks 64 bit counts

== TIME ==

Here are the comments for the time module

{{{

\
\ 2012-Feb-04 Status: Alpha
\
\ Provides a high resolution long time system timer by using one cog
\ to update a 64-bit counter as rapidly as possible. The main word is
\ _tickCounter ( addr_dticks _timelock -- ) 
\
\ When this words starts it sets the default time zone,
\ Sets the default time to 2012-01-01_12:00:00 UTC,
\ and adjusts the parameters to the current clkfreq 
\
\ This word will be run on one cog at system startup.
\
\ Counts system clock cycles (ticks) since system startup as an
\ unsigned double long.
\
\ Update read cycle is approximately 1 - 2 microseconds on an
\ 80 Mhz system.
\
\ This is because we have to use a lock, to update, or to read the
\ 2 longs that make up the double counter.
\
\ The words which update the double counter, and which read the
\ double counter, are written in assembler to ensure maximum resolution.
\ 
\ This provides a range of about 7,311 years at 80 Mhz
\ 2^64 / 80,000,000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
\
\ The range will vary if the clock frequency changes, the design point
\ on this was an 80 Mhz system
\
\ Time is then calculated as ticks since 1970-Jan-01_00:00:00
\ only unsigned counts are considered, so minimum date is 1970-Jan-01_00:00:00
\
\ So for the unix people, you can generate a unix time stamp easily
\
\ NOTE: UTC -> local timezone conversion can cause an underflow. 
\
\ setTimeZone ( h m -- ) - sets the time zone h and m can be positive or negative
\
\ setTime ( y m d h m s -- ) sets the UTC time
\
\ setLocalTime ( y m d h m s -- ) subtracts the time zone, then sets UTC time
\
\ getTime ( -- y m d h m s ticks -- ) gets UTC time
\
\ getLocalTime ( -- y m d h m s ticks -- ) gets local time
\ 
\ formatTime ( -- y m d h m s ticks -- cstr) formats a to a printable sortable string
\
\ getTimeStr( -- cstr) get the current UTC time as a string
\
\ getLocalTimeStr( -- cstr) get the current local time as a string
\
\ time ( -- ) print the local time
\
\ setDriftCorrection ( n1 -- ) sets the time correction to n1 ticks per day
\
\ utc ( -- ) print the utc time
\
\ timeStamp ( -- lo hi) gets a number which is the time stamp in microseconds (UTC)
\                       the number of microseconds since 1970-01-01_00:00:00
\                       print with d. or the double format words 
\
\ unixTimeStamp ( -- lo hi) gets a number which is the time stamp in seconds (UTC)
\                           the number of seconds since 1970-01-01_00:00:00
\                           print with d. or the double format words

= RUNNING the Logger example =

Load the PropForth SD Kernel.  I used a Quickstart and the default pin assignments from spinneret. 

http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/SDsetupREVISITED#Spineret_%28standard%29_Pinout

This is  kind is kind of neat in that Quickstart LEDs flash each time a record is written.

== test the SD kernel ==

Reboot the quickstart.   If you have no SD plugged in the slot, or you have an un-initialize SD card, you should get the cryptic error message.

Run the CrEatE_SD script if you have not already done so.

Reboot the Quickstat again.  When the SD is initialized and plugged in correctly, you should be the boot message sdispalying the SD size etc.

NOTE: the goofy message `braino rules 2X !!!usrboot.f  -  DONE`  is present to demonstarte that the script is running, and that it took my modifications.


== Load Logger example code ==

Open the Logger zipfile you downloaded. 

Open each of the files in turn in your editor, and paste these into the terminal emulator as normal.

I did:

 * DoubleMath.f
 * time.f  - I modified this to time-cst.f, changing the timezone from Vancouver to Chicago.
 * LoggerBoot.f
 * Loggerinit.f

Notice that the first three files create source code files on the mountsys partition.  You can display these to verify their contents using:

{{{
mountsys

ls

fread DoubleMath.f
fread  time.f  
fread LoggerBoot.f
}}}


Notice that the last one LoggerInit.f creates a file `log` on the mountusr partion.   You can display the contents of this using:

{{{
mountusr

ls 

fread log
}}}

Notice the log is empty when you first start out.

== Reboot to automatically start the logger ==

Reboot

Notice the Quickstart LED's start flashing about EXACTLY every second. (They are not really exactly every second yet, you did not do calibration yet; but its purdy durn close).

AFter several seconds, dispaly the contenct of the log file agian


{{{
mountusr

ls 

fread log
}}}

Notice the log has data

== clear the log ==

While I've been typing this, the log has been filling up with data that say its from 2012-01-01 5 AM.  
{{{
fread log
}}}

Notice that even at 230400 baud, it takes a little time to print out the records. It took me 21 second to print data for 32 minutes worth of log.

Clear the log using:

{{{
ClearLog
}}}

Check that new data is in the log:

{{{
fread log
}}

== Set the time ==

We can do any operation without stopping the logger.   This include  reading the log, and setting the time.  The logger cog takes care of it. 

To set the time we use the setLocalTime finction defined in the time.f file, which is autoloaded on boot.

{{{

\ setLocalTime ( y m d h m s -- ) subtracts the time zone, then sets UTC time
: setLocalTime
	ymdhms>t _dsetLocaltime
;
