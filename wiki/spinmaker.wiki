The file [http://code.google.com/p/propforth/w/edit/spimaker.f spimaker.f] contains an extension to the forth kernel that creates spin code from the currently running forth dictionary. 

Words that have been redefined only keep the newest definition.  This recovers space previously occupied by old versions of a definition.
