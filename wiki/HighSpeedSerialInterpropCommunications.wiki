= Introduction =

As of PropForth 3.6 Beta, there exists support for high speed serial communications between props. This permits the eight cogs in a single prop to communicate with cogs in up to eight slave cogs.  Each slave may also be a sub-master to up to seven sub-slaves. Sub-masters and sub-slaves may be continued as needed.

This capability may provide the basis for a micro-controller "supercomputer array".
