#summary BEGINNERS START HERE



This page is the result of a request for "PropForth for BASIC users". Turns out the instructins were too complex, now ANYBODY should be able to get started here. 

FIRST THING:  STACKS! http://www.forth.org/svfig/Len/softstak.htm

The "stack".  Once you figure this out, you are golden.

= Summary =

  * Read this page
  * Download and extract the archive PropForthv5.x-20130xxx.zip
  * Find PropForthDevkernel.spin (the program) in the extracted files
  * Find PropForth.htm (the reference manual) in the extracted files
  * Load PropForthDevkernel.spin onto the propboard per the instuction in the PropTool
  * SKIM the first for sections of PropForth.htm (the reference manual) doing the examples as you go.  This should take about 20 minutes

You are now ready to get started.

REMEMBER:  Just skim the reference manual the first time through.  It should take no more than 20 minutes (otherwise you are not skimming enough).  


  * READ (not just skim) the first for sections of PropForth.htm (the reference manual) doing the examples as you go


REMEMBER:  After your SKIMMED the first four sections, go back and read it again a little more carefully.  It WILL START TO MAKE SENSE after you skimmed it once, AND DONE THE EXAMPLES!.  The second time, take a little longer and do more experiments. The second pass should take about two hours.
