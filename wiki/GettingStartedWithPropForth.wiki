FIRST THING:  STACKS! http://www.forth.org/svfig/Len/softstak.htm

The "stack".  Once you figure this out, you are golden.

= Simple Instructions =
 
You should be able to get up to speed in an afternoon. 

== first Pass 20 minutes ==

  * Read this page
  * download and instal the PropTool http://www.parallax.com/ProductInfo/Microcontrollers/PropellerDownloads/tabid/442/Default.aspx
  * Download and extract the archive PropForthv5.x-20130xxx.zip
  * Find PropForthDevkernel.spin (the program) in the extracted files
  * Find PropForth.htm (the reference manual) in the extracted files
  * Load PropForthDevkernel.spin onto the propboard per the instuction in the PropTool
  * SKIM the first for sections of PropForth.htm (the reference manual) doing the examples as you go.  This should take about 20 minutes

You are now ready to get started.

REMEMBER:  Just skim the reference manual the first time through.  It should take no more than 20 minutes (otherwise you are not skimming enough).  

== Second pass 2 hours ==

  * READ (not just skim) the first for sections of PropForth.htm (the reference manual) doing the examples as you go


REMEMBER:  After your SKIMMED the first four sections, go back and read it again a little more carefully.  It WILL START TO MAKE SENSE after you skimmed it once, AND DONE THE EXAMPLES!.  The second time, take a little longer and do more experiments. The second pass should take about two hours.  



= Whats all the rest? =

Some folks might notice that there is more material beyond  !PropForth.spin and !PropForth.htm 

In fact, there is a TON more stuff.  EVERYTHING is included, to the extent that an interested user can re-rcreate the entire kernel from scratch, and or modify anything and everything to any given purpose.  

YOU DON'T want to do this just yet!  There are only about five people in the world that can use the extra stuff, and I'm not even one of them. Sal is very thorough.  He knows that if we did our job right, somebody will eventually learn enough and want to use the full power of Propforth.  But this is the long term use, we need to focus on the immediate needs of the beginners. 

= What do I really want to do? =

Fist thing you want to do is try all the examples.  

Then you want to try changing bits of the examples to get used to using propforth. 

Then you want to try to make a specific, simple application.  

For example, turn on the LED's when the lights go off in the room. 

Then try a more complex application.  

Before you know it, you will be more expert than me.

The learning curve is very steep, but very fun.
