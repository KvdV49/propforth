= Introduction =

The DS00 Time-of-Flight Laser Rangefinder using DS00VQ100 timing chip.

The DS00 sends a pulse of laser light and measures the time until detection of the reflected pulse.  

The DS00 is currently shipped with a set of demo firmware written in C that is designed to demonstrate the devices basic capabilities.

This project is to explore the device and the ds00vq100 timing chip on which it is based. 

Once the functional requirements are established, a new application firmware for the propeller micro controller will be generated.

This project intends to result in a propforth application for the propeller micro controller included in the DS00 unit.  However, the functional requirements could be used to implement a sufficient application using any suitable micro controller, using any suitable programming language and environment.
