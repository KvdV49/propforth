#summary Setup for GO  language using CSP channels.

= Introduction =

Propforth uses communication channels similar to those in CSP
http://www.usingcsp.com/

GO language also uses similar communications channels
http://golang.org/

The idea is to use the Prop for interafcaing to sensors and actualtors, and using a workstation to do the number crunching,  network communication, display, operator input and storage services.

The prop and the workstation interface will be the CSP commucations channels between propforth and the GO language (or any other that supports communications channels) on the workstation.

= SETUP The Work Station =

The big issue is that some OS use [forward] slash (/) and some use backslach (\), this serves to screw up the path names.  This configuartion aims to resolve those issues in a standard, reproducable manner. 

NOTE:  I tried to setup my rig so the dat was on the G drive instead of the C drive, and it DID NOT work.  So these instructions are exactly the way Sal did it using C drive.

The communucations channels make the device on the other end transparent.  So we want to be able to show that OS (windows, linux, Mac) ar4e equivalent, and the particular workstation (x86 PC, Mac, Raspberry Pi, ZipIt2) are functionally equivalent, and so the workstation hardware can be scaled to the task at hand. 

== Target tool chain for workstation ==

The workstation tool chain will be (for now): 
 # windows XP
 # GO language
 # EMACS text editor

=== Windows XP ===

We're starting with windows xp since its already on a machine

Steps -
 * Control panel - system - advanced - environment variables 
 * system variable  - new
 * Varaible name: {{{ GO_ROOT }}}
 * Varialbe Value: {{{  C:\go }}}

User Variables
 * Varaible name: {{{ HOME }}}
 * Varialbe Value: {{{   C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\Go-Docs }}}

PATH
edit add 
{{{
; C:\go\bin
}}}
Fromn Dos shell (run cmd:
{{{ 
path
echo %go_root%
ech %home%
 }}}

should rreflect the changes we made

Dos shell GO
 should give go descrivption


=== GO LAnguage ===

http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/detail?name=go.weekly.2012-03-13.windows-386.zip&can=2&q=

Move Go directory to C:\go

=== EMACS Editor ===

EMACS was selected since it has aspects which make it compatible with (people who think in propforth) forth.   Each user is free to use an alternative editor or environment,
