= Introduction =

Code Review is the technique to get "another set of eyes" to look at the code. 

There are various studies freely available on the web that show the use and benefits of "Software Code Review". 

The goal is to ensure that the code is clear and concise, and does "what is supposed to do".

This ensures that the code is maintainable and usable.

The code review is potentially the documentation and educational material for each piece of software.

This discussion uses the example of ANSI.f as the subject of the first example code review.  The most recent author is prof_braino (real name withheld due to previous issues with identity theft)

= Guidelines and Rules =

== Rules =  

Can:

 Reviewers can ask for clarification on intent of any peice of code under review
 
 Reviewers can identify issues for other peices of code (and trigger an new review on that code)

 Reviewers can state "I don't understand" or "I don't get it"  for any peice of code

Cannot:

 Participants cannot make derogatory statements about another participant's work 

 Participants cannot make a personal attack on participants.

 I.E. Any person that says "this code is stupid", or "you're stupid" will not be invited to participate. 


 == Guidelines ==

Guidelines for the code review process:

 Leader is usually the author

 Leader decides code is ready for review

 Leader calls the review

 Leader invites participants 
 
 Leader negotiates and arranges times, dead lines so there is sufficient time to prepare.

 Participants commit to participate by accepting the review invitation 

 Participants prepare by reading the materials in advance of the review
 
 Participants prepare by writing questions about the materials in advance of the review

 Participants prepare by sending list of questions to Leader/Author in advance of the agreed upon deadline.  (i.e. "We'll get questions back to you by Tuesday")

Any reviews that do not adhere to these guidelines should be noted,  and the guidelines should be updated to describe what actually needs to happen.   

= Code Review Preparation =

The Leader/Author prepares the review package.

The Review package contains the items needed for the review as determined by the team.
