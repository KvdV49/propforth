#summary Testing the SR04 with New Knowledge.

= Introduction =

Initially, the LittleRobot BOM specificed a 220-330 ohm resistor.  This was incorrect.  The new information is at:

and

= SR04 output issue =

The SR04 output (echo pin) is at 5 volts. This is too high for the Prop, which uses 3.3 volts.  A directly connection would very quickly damage the prop input. 

= The CORRECT SOLUTION(s)=

== The textbook solution is a voltage divider.  ==

=== 1.7k and 3.3k ===

This worked but the resistors might need to be changed again 

  * Use a 1.7k ohm resistor at the echo pin from the SRO4
  * use a 3.3k ohm resistor at the Prop input (pin 17 in Spring 2013 session)
  * connect the OTHER side of the 1.7k and 3.3k ohm resistors TOGETHER,  attach THE JUNCTION to ground.
  
I haven;'t figured out how to attach a picture here, but is you google for "5volt to 3.3volt voltage divider", you should get and image with correct connections.

I tested this and the S04 began to functihttp://www.parallaxsemiconductor.com/an010on, even on units that I thought may have been damaged. 

THIS STILL MIGHT BE TOO LOW!! 1.2 mA is too much!!
It needs to be 500 uA!!!

So 0.0012 A is too high, we want 0.0005 Amps maximum! 


= From that Parallax App 10 Note = 

Parallax appnote (#10) "Low-cost Bidirectional Mixed-voltage Interfacing" - interfacing 5V signals to the Prop using a resistor.

http://www.parallaxsemiconductor.com/an010

A single resitor inline should do the trick.

They calculate 4.6k as the minimum resistor value for 5 volt signals.

Test 4.6 K !!!!

= checking for damage =

At least 4 of the ten Ancona Bots from Spring 2013 had the incorrect resistor. Here is how we check the imputs

{{{
How can we test if the protection diode is damaged?
Apply 5V through a 3.3K resistor and measure the voltage on the pin. It should be around 3.9V if the diode is intact and functioning properly.
