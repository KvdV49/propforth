#summary simple IDE complies and loads C code to the prop

= Introduction =

simple IDE compiles and loads C code to to the prop.

The kalman filter code I received is in C.  I want to see if it works as-is before I try to mess with it in FORTH.

= Hardware =

PC - Linux Minut 17 -64

Propeller - Quickstart

= Software =

This should be fairly refined at this point.

== download ==

I used 0.9.66 for Linux (64 bit i686)

I downloaded the instruction linked on the page, those are special in that the text has a carrage return after each letter.  Wonderful. 


== install ==

in a terminal window enter

{{{
sudo dpkg -i simpleide-0.6.99-amd64-debian-linux.deb
}}}

you will get errors, ignore them and type

{{{
sudo apt-get install -f
}}}

After this finsishes, add your user ID to the dialout group

{{{
sudo adduser ${USER} dialout
}}}

Powercycle so the changes take.

= Create a launcher Icon =

This is how its done in Mint 17, please adjust these steps if you use ubuntu, etc.

I created a launcher so I can click instead of type:

Right click on PANEL

select + Add To Panel

select Custom Application Launcher

Launcher Type: Application?

Name: simpleIDE

Command: Browse: (navigate to /usr/bin/simpleide )
