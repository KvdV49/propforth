= Introduction =

As of version 3.2, the entire PropForth file set is packaged into a single zip file download
[http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/PropForthspin?ts=1279464157&updated=PropForthspin PropForth.spin] is contained in that archive. 

This page exists to have a place for Google Code to auto link the '[http://code.google.com/p/propforth/wiki/PropForthspin?ts=1279464157&updated=PropForthspin PropForth.spin]' text. 

This page contains more detailed explanations for user questions raised on the code. 

= 64k  EEPROM vs 32K EEPROM =

The stock demo board has a 32k EEPROM while the stock proto board has 64k EEPROM.
Version 2.4 of propforth used 64 byte EEPROM page writes, but this was found to be unsupported on the 32k EEPROM parts.  This was the cause of the 'saveforth' word failing on the demo boards.

Propfroth 2.5 onward uses 32 byte EEPROM page writes, which is supported on all EEPROM parts seen so far. The only impact is that the EEPROM write routine does twice as many page writes. 

If an application requires 64 byte page writes to EEPROM,



= Version String =

The version string is located around line 5280 as seen in the Propeller Tool. 
If changes are made to the file it is recommended that this string be updated to the current date and time, or to some other unique value to differentiate the new version from the posted version. 

{{{
     byte    $20,"PropForth v3.2 2010JUL09 15:30 0"
}}}
 The $20 reserves 32 byte for the string.  This can be changed to accomodate any size string required.  

The FINAL CHARACTER should be a zero.  This final character is AUTO INCREMENTED by the 'saveforth' word.
